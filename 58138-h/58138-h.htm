<p><i>MY LORD</i>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I hope your pardon,
if while you are
holding <i>that Best of
Books</i> in one Hand, I here
present some Pages of
that of <i>Nature</i> into your
other: Especially since
<i>your Lordship</i> knoweth
very well, how excellent
a <i>Commentary</i> This is on
the <i>Former</i>; by which,
in part God reads the
World his own Definition,
and their Duty to
him.</p>

<p>But if this Address, <i>my
Lord</i>, may be thought
congruous, ’tis yet more
just; and that I should let
<i>your Lordship</i>, and others
know, how much, and
how deservedly I resent
your extraordinary Favours:
Particularly that
you were pleased so far
to animate my Endeavours
towards the publishing
the following <i>Observations</i>.
Many whereof,
and most belonging
to <a href="#CHAP_I">the First Chapter</a>, having
now lain dormant
near seven years; and yet
might perhaps have so
continued, had not <i>your
Lordships</i> Eye at length
created Light upon them.
In doing which, you have
given one, amongst those
many Tokens, of as well
your readiness to promote
learning and knowledge
by the hands of others;
as your high Abilities to
do it by your own. Both
which are so manifest in
<i>your Lordship</i>, that like
the first Principles of <i>Mathematical
Science</i>, they
are not so much to be asserted,
because known
and granted by all.</p>

<p>The Consideration
whereof, <i>my Lord</i>, may
make me not only <i>just</i> in
owning of your Favours,
but also most <i>Ambitious</i>
of your <i>Patronage</i>: which
yet to bespeak, I must confess
I cannot well. Not
that I think what is good
and valuable, is alwaies its
own best Advocate; for
I know that the Censures
of men are humorous and
variable, and that one
Age must have leave to
frown on those Books,
which another will do nothing
less than kiss and
embrace. But chiefly
for this Reason, lest I
should so much as seem
desirous of <i>your Lordships</i>
Solliciting my Cause
as to all I have said: For
as it is your Glory, that
you like not so to shine, as
to put out the least Star;
so were it to your Dishonour
to borrow your
Name to illustrate the
Spots, though of the
most conspicuous.</p>

Most Obliged<br />
&amp;<br />
Most Humble<br />
Servant</p>

<p class="dropcap-img"><i>Of what antiquity the
<span class="antiqua">Anatomy</span> of <span class="antiqua">Animals</span>
is, and how great have
been its Improvements
of later years, is well
known. That of <span class="antiqua">Vegetables</span> is a
subject which from all Ages to this
day hath not only lain by uncultivated;
but for ought I know, except
some Observations of some of our own
Countrey-men, hath not been so much
as thought upon; whether for that
the World hath been more enamoured
with the former, or pity to humane
frailty hath more obliged to it, or
other Reasons, I need not enquire.</i></p>

<p><i>But considering that both came at
first out of the same Hand, and are
therefore the Contrivances of the
same Wisdom; I thence fully assured
my self, that it could not be a vain
Design, though possibly unsuccessful,
to seek it in both.</i></p>

<p><i>In the prosecution hereof, how far
I have gone, I neither judge my self,
nor leave it to any one else to do it;
because no man knows how far we
have yet to go, or are capable of going.
Nor is there any thing which
starves and stinteth the growth of
knowledge more, than such Determinations,
whether we speak or conceit
them only.</i></p>

<p><i>What we have performed thus far,
lieth, for the most part, open to the
use and improvement of all men. Only
in some places, and chiefly in <a href="#CHAP_III">the
Third Chapter</a>, we have taken in the
help of Glasses; wherein, after we
had finished the whole Composure,
some Observations made by that
Ingenious and Learned Person
Mr. <span class="antiqua">Hook</span>, a Worthy Member of the
<span class="antiqua">Royal Society</span>, my much Honoured
Friend, and by him communicated to
me, were super-added: As likewise
some others also <span class="antiqua">Microscopical</span>, of
my own, which his gave me the occasion
of making.</i></p>

<p><i>Those that shall think fit to examine,
as well as to peruse these Observations,
we advertise them, <span class="antiqua">First</span>,
That they begin, and so proceed till
they end again, with the Seed: For
they will hardly be able to avoid Errour
and Misapprehension, if either
partial or preposterous in their Enquiries.
<span class="antiqua">Next</span>, That they confine
not their Enquiries to one time of
the Year; but to make them in several
Seasons, wherein the Parts of a
<span class="antiqua">Vegetable</span> may be seen in their several
Estates. <span class="antiqua">And then</span>, That they
neglect not the comparative <span class="antiqua">Anatomy</span>;
for as some things are better
seen in one estate, so in one <span class="antiqua">Vegetable</span>,
than another.</i></p>

<p><i>What, upon Observation already
made, we have erected, as they are
not Sticks and Straws; so neither
do we assure all to be of the best Oak.
How Dogmatical soever my Assertions
may seem to be, yet do I not affect
the unreasonable Tyranny of obtruding
upon the Faith of any. He that
speaketh Reason, may be rather satisfied,
in being understood, than believed.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap-img">Being to speak of Vegetables;
and, as far as Inspection
and consequent
Reason may conduct, to
enquire into the visible Constitutions
and Uses of their several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Parts; I chuse that Method which
may with best advantage suit to
what we have to say hereon: And
that is the Method of Nature
her self, in her continued Series
of Vegetations, proceeding from
the Seed sown, to the formation
of the Root, Trunk, Branch,
Leaf, Flower, Fruit, and last of
all, of the Seed also to be sown
again; all which we shall in the
same order particularly speak of.</p>

<p>The Essential Constitutions of
the said Parts are in all Vegetables
the same: But for Observation,
some are more convenient; in
which I shall chiefly instance. And
first of all, for the Seed we chuse
the great Garden-Bean.</p>

<p>If we take a Bean then and dissect
it, we shall find it cloathed
with a double Vest or Coat:
These Coats, while the Bean is
yet green, are separable, and easily
distinguished. When ’tis dry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
they cleave so closely together,
that the Eye, not before instructed,
will judge them but one; the
inner Coat likewise (which is of
the most rare contexture) so far
shrinking up, as to seem only the
roughness of the outer, somewhat
resembling Wafers under <i>Maquaroons</i>.</p>

<p>At the thicker end of the Bean,
in the outer Coat, a very small <i>Foramen</i>
presents it self: In dissection
’tis found to terminate against
the point of that part which I call
the <i>Radicle</i>, whereof I shall presently
speak. It is of that capacity
as to admit a small Virginal Wyer,
and is most conspicuous in a
green Bean.</p>

<p>This <i>Foramen</i> may be observed
not only in the great Garden-Bean,
but likewise in the other kinds; in
the French-Bean very plainly; in
Pease, Lupines, Vetches, Lentiles,
and other Pulse ’tis also found; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
in many Seeds not reckoned of
this kindred, as in that of <i>Fœnugreek</i>,
<i>Medica Tornata</i>, <i>Goats-Rue</i>,
and others: In many of which,
’tis so very small, as scarcely, without
the help of Glasses to be discovered;
and in some, not without
cutting off part of the Seed besides,
which otherwise would intercept
the sight hereof; it being in
these and such like Seeds, from
the place of the breaking off of
the Peduncle perfectly distinct.</p>

<p>We may then observe, that all
Seeds which have thick or hard
Coats, have the same likewise
perforated, in this, or some other
manner. And accordingly, although
the Coats of such Seeds as are
lodg’d in Shells or Stones, being
thin, are not visibly perforated;
yet the Stones and Shells themselves
always are; as <a href="#CHAP_VII"><i>Chap. 7.</i></a> shall
be seen how. To which Chapter,
what is farther observable, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
as to the nature, or number of the
covers of the Seed, I also refer.</p>

<p>The Coats of the Bean being
stripp’d off the proper Seed shews
it self. The parts whereof it is
constituted, are three; <i>sc.</i> the
main Body, and two other appendant
to it, which we may call the
three Organical parts of the Bean.</p>

<p>The main Body is not one entire
piece, but alwaies divided lengthwise
into two halves or Lobes,
which are both joyn’d together at
the Basis of the Bean. These Lobes
in dry Beans, are but difficultly
separated or observ’d; but in
young ones, especially boil’d, they
easily slip asunder. <a href="#figures1">See <i>Fig. 1</i>.</a></p>

<p>Some very few Seeds are divided,
not into two Lobes, but
more; as that of <i>Cresses</i>; and some
not at all divided, but entire; as
<i>Corn</i>: Excepting which few, all
other Seeds, even the smallest are
divided, like as the Bean, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
just two Lobes: whereof though
in most Seeds we cannot by dissection
be inform’d; yet otherwise
we easily may as shall be
seen.</p>

<p>At the Basis of the Bean, the
two other Organical parts stand
appendent; by mediation whereof
the two Lobes meet and join together.
The greater of these
two parts stands without the two
Lobes, and upon divesting the
Bean of its Coats, is immediately
visible. ’Tis of a whiter colour,
and more glossie than the main Body,
especially when the Bean is
young. In the Bean, and many
other Seeds, tis situated somewhat
above the thicker end, as you hold
the Bean in its most proper posture
for growth. In Oak-Kernels, which
we call Acorns, Apple-Kernels,
Almonds, and many other Seeds,
it stands prominent just from the
end; the Basis and the end being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in these the same, but in the Bean
divers. <a href="#figures1">See <i>Fig. 1</i>.</a></p>

<p>This part is not only in the Bean,
and the Seeds above mentioned;
but in all others: being that which
upon the Vegetation of the Seed,
becomes the Root of the Plant;
which therefore I call the <i>Radicle</i>:
by which, I mean the Materials,
abating the Formality, of a Root,
’Tis not easie to be observed, saving in
some few Seeds, amongst
which, that of the Bean is the
most fair and ample of all I have
seen; but that of some other Seeds,
is, in proportion, greater; as of
<i>Fœnugreek</i>, which is almost as big
as one of its Lobes.</p>

<p>The lesser of the two laid Appendents
lies occult between the
two Lobes of the Bean, by separation
whereof only it is to be seen.
’Tis enclos’d in two small Cavities
form’d in the Lobes for its reception.
Its colour comes near that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the <i>Radicle</i>; and is founded upon
the Basis thereof having a quite
contrary production, <i>sc.</i> towards
the cone of the Bean; and being
that very part, which, in process,
becomes the Body or Trunk of
the Vegetable. <a href="#figures1">See <i>Fig. 1</i>.</a></p>

<p>For the sake of this Part principally
it is, that the Bean is divided
into Lobes; <i>sc.</i> that it may be warmly
and safely lodged up between
them; and so secur’d from the Injuries
so tender a Part would sustain
from the Mould, whereto, had
the Main Body been entire, it must upon the Sprouting of the <i>Bean</i>
have lain contiguous.</p>

<p>This Part is not, like the <i>Radicle</i>,
an entire Body, but divided
at its loose end into divers pieces,
all very close set together, as Feathers
in a Bunch; for which reason
it may be called the <i>Plume</i>.
They are so close, that only two
or three of the outmost are at first
seen: but upon a nice and curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
separation of these, the more interiour
still may be discovered.
Now as the <i>Plume</i> is that Part
which becomes the Trunk of the
Plant, so these pieces are so many
true, and already formed, though
not displayed, Leaves, intended
for the said Trunk, and foulded
up in the same plicature, wherein,
upon the sprouting of the Bean,
they afterwards appear. In a French
Bean the two outmost are very fair
and elegant. In the great Garden-Bean,
two extraordinary small
Plumes, often, if not always, stand
one on either side the great one
now describ’d: From which, in
that they differ in nothing save in
their size, I therefore only here
just take notice of them. And these
three Parts, <i>sc.</i> the <i>Main Body</i>, the
<i>Radicle</i>, and the <i>Plume</i>, are concurrent
to the making up of every
Seed; and no more than these.</p>

<p>Having thus taken a view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Organical Parts of the Bean, let
us next examine the Similary, <i>sc.</i>
those whereof the Organical are
compos’d: a distinct observation
of which, for a clear understanding
of the Vegetation of the Seed,
and of the whole Plant arising
thence, is requisite: To obtain
which, we must proceed in our Anatomy.</p>

<p>Dissecting a Bean then, the first
Part occurring is its Cuticle. The
Eye and first Thoughts suggest it
to be only a more dense and glossy
Superficies; but better enquiry
discovers it a real Cuticle. ’Tis so
exquisitely thin, and for the most
part so firmly continuous with the
Body of the Bean, that it cannot,
except in some small Rag, be distinctly
seen; which, by carrying
your Knife superficially into the
Bean, and then very gently bearing
upward what you have cut,
will separate and shew it self transparent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
This Cuticle is not only
spread upon the Convex of the
Lobes, but also on their Flats,
where they are contiguous, extending
it self likewise upon both the
<i>Radicle</i> and <i>Plume</i>, and so over
the whole Bean.</p>

<p>This Part, though it be so far
common with the Coats of the
Bean, as to be like those, an Integument;
yet are we in a quite different
Notion to conceive of it:
For whereas the Coats upon setting
the Bean, do only administer
the Sap, and, as being superseded
from their Office, then die; as shall
be seen: this, on the contrary, with
the Organical Parts of the Bean,
is nourished, augmented, and by
a real Vegetation co-extended.</p>

<p>Next to the Cuticle, we come
to the <i>Parenchyma</i> it self; the Part
throughout which the <i>inner Body</i>,
whereof we shall speak anon,
is disseminated; for which reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
I call it the <i>Parenchyma</i>. The Surface
hereof is somewhat dense,
but inwardly ’tis more porous, and
of a laxer Contexture. If you view
it in a Microscope, it hath some similitude
to the Pith, while sappy,
in the Roots and Trunks of Plants;
and that for good reason, as in <a href="#CHAP_II"><i>Ch.
2.</i></a> shall be seen. This is best seen
in green Beans. <a href="#figures1">See <i>Fig. 2</i>.</a></p>

<p>This Part would seem by its colour
to be peculiar to the Lobes of
the Bean; but as is the Cuticle, so
is this also, common both to the
<i>Radicle</i> and <i>Plume</i>; that is, the
<i>Parenchyma</i> of the Bean, as to its
essential substance, is the same in
all three. The reason why the colour
of the <i>Plume</i>, and especially
of the <i>Radicle</i>, which is white, is
so different from that of the Lobes,
may chiefly depend upon their being
more compact and dense, and thence their different
Tinctures. And
therefore the Lobes themselves,
which are green while the Bean is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
young; yet being old and dry,
become whitish too. And in many
other Seeds, as Acorns, Almonds,
the Kernels of Apples,
Plums, Nuts, <i>&amp;c.</i> the Lobes, even
fresh and young, are pure white as
the Radicle it self.</p>

<p>But although the <i>Parenchyma</i> be
common, as is said, to all the Organical
Parts; yet in very differing
proportions. In the <i>Plume</i>, where
it is proportionably least, it maketh
about three Fifths of the
whole <i>Plume</i>; in the <i>Radicle</i>, it
maketh about five Seavenths of the
whole <i>Radicle</i>; and in each Lobe,
is so far over-proportionate, as to
make at least nine Tenths of the
whole Lobe.</p>

<p>By what hath been said, that
the <i>Parenchyma</i> is not the only constituting Part,
besides the Cuticle,
is imply’d: there being another
Body, of an essentially different
substance, embosom’d herein:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which may be found, not only in
the <i>Radicle</i> and <i>Plume</i>, but also in
the Lobes themselves, and so in
the whole Bean. <a href="#figures1">See <i>Fig. 2</i>.</a></p>

<p>This inner Body appears most
plain and conspicuous in cutting
the <i>Radicle</i> athwart, and so proceeding
by degrees towards the
<i>Plume</i>, through both which it runneth
in a large and straight Trunk.
In the Lobes, being it is there in so
very small proportion, ’tis difficultly
seen, especially towards
their Verges: yet if with a sharp
Knife you smoothly cut the Lobes
of the Bean athwart, divers small
Specks, of a different colour from
that of the <i>Parenchyma</i>, standing
therein all along in a Line, may be
observ’d; which Specks are the
Terminations of the Branches of
this inner Body. <a href="#figures1">See <i>Fig. 3</i>.</a></p>

<p>For this inner Body, as it is existent
in every Organical part of the
Bean, so is it, with respect to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
part, most regularly distributed. In
a good part of the <i>Radicle</i> ’tis one
entire Trunk; towards the Basis
thereof, ’tis divided into three
main Branches; the middlemost
runneth directly into the Plume;
the other two on either side it, after
a little space, pass into the
Lobes; where the said Branches
dividing themselves into other
smaller; and those into more, and
smaller again, are terminated towards
the Verges of each Lobe;
in which manner the said inner Body
being distributed, it becomes
in each Lobe, a true and perfect
Root. <a href="#figures1">See <i>Fig. 2</i>.</a></p>

<p>This Seminal Root, as now we’ll
call it, being so tender, cannot be
perfectly excarnated, as may the
Vessels in the Parts of an Animal,
by the most accurate Hand; yet
by dissection begun and continu’d,
as is above-declared, its whole
frame and distribution may be easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
observ’d. Again, if you take
the Lobe of a Bean, and lengthwise
pare off its <i>Parenchyma</i> by degrees,
and in very thin Shives, many
Branches of the Seminal Root,
(which by the other way of Dissection
were only noted by so many
Specks) both as they are fewer about
the Basis of the Bean, and more
numerous towards its Verges, in
some good distinction and entireness
will appear. For this you
must have new Beans.</p>

<p>As the inner Body is branched
out in the Lobes, so is it in the
<i>Plume</i>: For if you cut the <i>Plume</i>
athwart, and from the Basis proceed
along the Body thereof, you’l
find therein, first, one large Trunk
or Branch, and after four or five
very small Specks round about it,
which are the terminations of so
many lesser Branches therewith distributed
to the several parts of
the <i>Plume</i>. <a href="#figures1">See <i>Fig. 4</i>.</a> The distribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of the inner Body, as it
is continuous throughout all the
Organical Parts of the Bean, is
represented by <a href="#figures1"><i>Fig. 2</i></a>.</p>

<p>This <i>Inner Body</i> is, by dissection,
best observable in the Bean
and great Lupine. In other larger
Pulse it shows likewise some obscure
Marks of it-self: But in no
other Seeds, which I have observed,
though of the greatest size,
as of <i>Apples</i>, <i>Plums</i>, <i>Nuts</i>, &amp;c. is
there any clear appearance hereof,
upon dissection, saving in the <i>Radicle</i>
and <i>Plume</i>; the reason of
which is partly from its quantity,
being in most Seeds so extraordinary
little; partly from its Colour,
which in most Seeds, is the
same with that of the <i>Parenchyma</i>
it self, and so not distinguishable
from it.</p>

<p>Yet in a <i>Gourd-Seed</i>, the whole
<i>Seminal Root</i>, not only its <i>Main
Branches</i>, but also the Sub-divisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and Inosculations of the lesser
ones, are without any dissection,
upon the separation of the Lobes,
on their contiguous Flats immediatly
apparent. <a href="#figures1">See <i>Fig. 5</i>.</a> And
as to the existence of this Seminal
Root, what Dissection cannot attain,
ocular inspection in hundreds
of other Seeds, even the smallest,
will demonstrate; as in this
<i>Chapter</i> shall be seen how.</p>

<p>In the mean time, let us only
take notice, that when we say every
Plant hath its Root, we reckon
short, for every Plant hath really
two, though not contemporary,
yet successive Roots, its Original
or <i>Seminal-Root</i> within its Seed,
and its <i>Plant-Root</i>, which the
<i>Radicle</i> becometh in its growth:
the <i>Parenchyma</i> of the Seed being
in some resemblance, that to the
<i>Seminal Root</i> at first, which the
Mould is to the <i>Plant-Root</i> afterwards;
and the <i>Seminal Root</i> being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that to the <i>Plant-Root</i>, which
the <i>Plant-Root</i> is to the <i>Trunk</i>.
For our better understanding
whereof, having taken a view of
the several Parts of a Bean, as far
as Dissection conducts; we will
next briefly enquire into the use
of the said Parts, and in what
manner they are the Fountain of
Vegetation, and concurrent to
the being of the future Plant.</p>

<p>The general Cause of the growth
of a <i>Bean</i> or other Seed, is <i>Fermentation</i>;
that is, the <i>Bean</i> lying
in the Mould, and a moderate
access of some moisture, partly
dissimilar, and partly congenerous,
being made, a gentle <i>Fermentation</i>
thence ariseth; by which the
<i>Bean</i> swelling, and the <i>Sap</i> still
encreasing, and the <i>Bean</i> continuing
still to swell, the work thus
proceeds: as is the usual way of
explicating. But that there is
simply a <i>Fermentation</i>, and so a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
sufficient supply of <i>Sap</i>, is not enough;
but that this <i>Fermentation</i>
and the <i>Sap</i> wherein ’tis made,
should be under a various Government
by divers Parts thereto
subservient, is also requisite; and
as the various preparation of the
<i>Aliment</i> in an <i>Animal</i>, equally
necessary, the particular process
of the Work according whereto,
we find none undertaking to declare.</p>

<p>Let us look upon a <i>Bean</i> then,
as a piece of Work so fram’d
and set together, as to declare a
Design for the production of a
Plant, which, upon its lying in
some convenient Soyl, is thus effected.
First of all, the <i>Bean</i>
being enfoulded round in its
Coats, the <i>Sap</i> wherewith it is
fed, must of necessity pass through
these: By which means, it is not
only in a proportionate quantity,
and by due degrees; but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in a purer body; and possibly
not without some Vegetable
Tincture, transmitted to the <i>Bean</i>.
Whereas, were the <i>Bean</i> naked,
the <i>Sap</i> must needs be, as over-copious,
so but crude and immature,
as not being filtred through
so fine a Cotton as the Coats be.
And as they have the use of a
<i>Filtre</i> to the transient <i>Sap</i>, so of
a Vessel to that which is still deposited
within them; being alike
accommodated to the securer
<i>Fermentation</i> hereof, as Bottles or
Barrels are to Beer, or any other
<i>Fermentative Liquor</i>.</p>

<p>And as the <i>Fermentation</i> is promoted
by some Aperture in the
Vessel; so have we the <i>Foramen</i> in
the upper Coat also contrived,
that if there should be need of
some more aiery Particles to excite
the <i>Fermentation</i>, through
this they may obtain their Entry:
Or, on the contrary, should there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
be any such Particles or Steams as
might damp the genuine proceeding
thereof, through this again
they may have easy issue: being
that, as a common Pasport here to
the <i>Sap</i>, which what we call the
Bung-hole of the Barrel, is to
the new-tunn’d Liquor. That this
<i>Foramen</i> is truly permeable even in
old setting <i>Beans</i>, appears upon
their being soak’d for some time in
Water: For then taking them
out, and crushing them a little,
many small bubbles will alternately
arise and break upon it.</p>

<p>The <i>Sap</i> being passed through
the Coats, it next enters the Body
of the <i>Bean</i>; yet not indiscriminately
neither; but, being filtred
through the <i>Outer Coat</i>, and
fermented both in the Body and
Concave of the <i>Inner</i>, is by mediation
of the <i>Cuticle</i>, again more
finely filtr’d, and so entereth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<i>Parenchyma</i> it self under a fourth
Government.</p>

<p>Through which Part the <i>Sap</i>
passing towards the <i>Seminal Root</i>,
as through that which is of a more
spacious content; besides the benefit
it hath of a farther percolation,
it will also find room enough
for a more free and active fermenting
and maturation herein.
And being moreover, part of the
true Body of the <i>Bean</i>, and so
with its proper Seminalities or
Tinctures copiously repleat; the
<i>Sap</i> will not only find room, but
also matter enough, by whose Energy
its <i>Fermentation</i> will still be
more advanced.</p>

<p>And the <i>Sap</i> being duly prepared
here, it next passeth into all
the Branches of the <i>Seminal Root</i>,
and so under a fifth Government.
Wherein how delicate ’tis now become,
we may conceive by the
proportion betwixt the <i>Parenchyma</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and this <i>Seminal Root</i>; so much
only of the best digested <i>Sap</i> being
discharged from the whole
Stock in that, as this will receive.
And this, moreover, as the <i>Parenchyma</i>,
with its proper Seminalities
being endowed; the <i>Sap</i>,
for the supply of the <i>Radicle</i>, and
of the young Root from thence,
is duly prepared therein, and with
its highest Tincture and Impregnation
at last enriched.</p>

<p>The <i>Sap</i> being thus prepared in
the Lobes of the <i>Bean</i>, ’tis thence
discharg’d; and either into the
<i>Plume</i> or the <i>Radicle</i>, must forthwith
issue. And since the <i>Plume</i>
is a dependent on the <i>Radicle</i>;
the <i>Sap</i> therefore ought first to
be dispenced to this; which accordingly
is ever found to shoot
forth before the <i>Plume</i>, and that
sometimes an inch or two in
length. Now because the primitive
course of the <i>Sap</i> into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<i>Radicle</i>, is thus requisite, therefore
by the frame of the Parts of
the <i>Bean</i> is it made necessary too.
For we may observe that the two
main Branches of the <i>Seminal Root</i>
in which the several <i>Ramifications</i>
in either Lobe are all united, commit
not themselves into the <i>Seminal
Trunk</i> of the <i>Plume</i>, nor yet
so as to stand at right Angles with
them, and with equal respect towards
them both; but being producted
through part of the <i>Parenchyma</i>
of the <i>Radicle</i>, are at last
united therein to the main Trunk,
and make acute Angles therewith;
as may be seen by <a href="#figures1"><i>Fig. 2</i></a>. Now
the <i>Sap</i> being brought as far as the
<i>Seminal Root</i> in either Lobe, and
according to the conduct thereof
continuing still to move, it must
needs immediately issue into the
same part whereinto the main
Branches themselves do, that is,
into the <i>Radicle</i>. By which <i>Sap</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
thus bringing the several Tinctures
of the parts aforesaid with it, being
now fed; it is no longer a meer
<i>Radicle</i>, but is made also <i>Seminal</i>,
and so becomes a perfect
Root.</p>

<p>The <i>Radicle</i> being thus impregnate
and shot into a root, ’tis
now time for the <i>Plume</i> to rouze
out of its Cloysters, and germinate
too: In order whereto, ’tis
now fed from the Root with laudable
and sufficient Aliment. For
as the Supplies and motion of the
<i>Sap</i> were first made from the
Lobes towards the Root, so the
Root being well shot into the
Moulds, and now receiving a new
and more copious <i>Sap</i> from these;
the motion hereof must needs be
stronger, and by degrees revert
the primitive <i>Sap</i>, and so move in
a contrary course, <i>sc.</i> from the Root
towards the <i>Plume</i>; and, by
the continuation of the <i>Seminal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
trunk</i>, is directly conducted
thereinto; by which, being fed,
it gradually enlarges and displayes
it self.</p>

<p>The course of the <i>Sap</i> thus turned,
it issues, I say, in a direct
Line from the <i>Root</i> into the <i>Plume</i>,
but collaterally into the Lobes also;
<i>sc.</i> by those two aforesaid
Branches which are obliquely
transmitted from the <i>Radicle</i> into
either Lobe. By which Branches
the said <i>Sap</i> being disbursed back
into all the <i>Seminal Root</i>, and from
thence likewise into the <i>Parenchyma</i>
of the Lobes; they are
both thus fed, and for some time
augmenting themselves, really
grow; as in <i>Lupines</i> is evident.</p>

<p>Yet is not this common to all
Seeds; some rot under-ground,
as <i>Corn</i>; being of a laxer and less
Oleous substance, differing herein
from most other Seeds; and being
not divided into Lobes, but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
entire thick Body. And some,
although they continue firm, yet
rise not as the great <i>Garden-Bean</i>;
in which therefore it is observable,
that the two Main Branches of the
Lobes in comparison with that
which runs into the <i>Plume</i>, are but
mean; and so insufficient to the
feeding and vegetation of the
Lobes; the <i>Plume</i>, on the contrary,
growing so lusty, as to mount
up without them.</p>

<p>Excepting a few of these two
kinds, all other Seeds whatsoever,
(which I have observed) besides
that they continue firm, upon the
Vegetation of the <i>Plume</i>, mount also
upwards, and advance above
the Mould together with it; as all
Seeds which spring up with dissimilar
Leaves, the two (for the most
part two) dissimilar Leaves, being
the very Lobes of the Seed divided, expanded, and
thus advanced.</p>

<p>The Impediments of our apprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hereof are the Colour,
Size and Shape of the dissimilar
Leaves. Notwithstanding, that
they are nothing else but the main
body of the Seed, how I came
first to phansie, and afterwards to
know it, was thus: First, I observed
in general that the dissimilar
Leaves were never jagg’d, but
even edg’d: And seeing the
even verges of the Lobes of the
Seed hereto respondent, I was apt
to think, that those which were
so like, might prove the same.
Next descending to particular
Seeds, I observed first of the <i>Lupine</i>;
that as to its Colour, upon
its advance above the Mould, it
ever changed into a perfect Green.
And why might not the same by
parity of Reason be inferr’d of other
Seeds? That, as to its size,
it grew but little bigger than
when first set. Whence, as I discern’d
(the Augmentation being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
but little) we here had only the
two Lobes: So, (as some augmentation
there was) I inferr’d the
like might be, and that, in farther
degrees, in other Seeds.</p>

<p>Next, of the <i>Cucumber</i>-seed.
That, as to its Colour, often appearing
above ground in its Primitive
white, from white it turns
to yellow, and from yellow to
green, the proper colour of a
Leaf: That, as to its size, though
at its first arise, the Lobes were
little bigger than upon setting;
yet afterwards as they chang’d
their Colour, so their Dimensions
also, growing to a three-four-five-fold
amplitude above their primitive
size: But whereas the Lobes
of the Seed are in proportion, narrow,
short and thick, how then
come the dissimilar Leaves to be
so exceeding broad, or long and
thin? The Question answers it
self: For the dissimilar Leaves, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
very reason are so thin, because so
very broad or long; as we see many
things, how much they are
extended in length or breadth,
so much they lose in depth, or
grow more thin; which is that
which here befalls the now effoliated
Lobes. For being once
disimprisoned from their Coats,
and the course of the Sap into
them now more and more encreased,
they must needs very considerably
amplifie themselves; and
from the manner wherein the <i>Seminal
Root</i> is branched in them,
that amplification cannot be in
thickness, but in length or breadth:
In both which, in some dissimilar
Leaves ’tis very remarkable; especially
in length, as in those of
<i>Lettice</i>, <i>Thorn-Apple</i>, and others;
whose Seeds, although very small,
yet the Lobes of those Seeds growing
up into Dissimilar Leaves, are
extended an Inch, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
more, in length; though he that
shall attempt to get a clear sight of
the Lobes of <i>Thorn-Apple</i>, and
some others, by Dissection, will
find it no easy Task; yet is that
which may be obtained. From
all which, and the observation of
other Seeds, I at last found, that
the dissimilar Leaves of a young
Plant, are nothing else but the
Lobes or <i>main Body</i> of its Seed:
So that as the Lobes did at first
feed and impregnate the <i>Radicle</i>
into a <i>perfect Root</i>; so the <i>Root</i>
being perfected, doth again feed,
and by degrees amplifie each Lobe
into a perfect Leaf.</p>

<p>The Original of the dissimilar
Leaves thus known, we understand,
why some Plants have
none; because the Seed either riseth
not, as <i>Garden-Beans</i>, <i>Corn</i>,
&amp;c. Or upon rising, the Lobes
are little alter’d, as <i>Lupines</i>, <i>Pease</i>,
&amp;c. Why, though the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Leaves are often indented round;
the dissimilar, like the Lobes, are
even-edg’d. Why, though the
proper Leaves are often hairy, yet
these are ever smooth. Why some
have more dissimilar Leaves than
two, as <i>Cresses</i>, which have six,
as the Ingenious Mr. <i>Sharrock</i> also
observes; the reason whereof is,
because the <i>Main Body</i> is not divided
into two, but six, distinct
Lobes, as I have often counted.
Why <i>Radishes</i> seem at first to have
four, which yet after appear plainly
two; because the Lobes of the
Seed have both a little Indenture,
and are both plaited, one over
the other. To which we might
add,</p>

<p>The use of the dissimilar Leaves
is, first, for the protection of the
<i>Plume</i>; which being but young,
and so but soft and tender, is provided
with these, as a double
Guard, one on either side of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
For this reason it is, that the <i>Plume</i>
in Corn is trussed up within a membranous
Sheath; and that of a
<i>Bean</i>, cooped up betwixt a pair
of <i>Surfoyls</i>; but where the Lobes
rise, there the <i>Plume</i> hath neither
of them, being both needless.</p>

<p>Again, that since the <i>Plume</i>, being
yet tender, may be injured not
only by the Air, but also for want
of Sap, the supplies from the Root
being yet but slow and sparing;
that the said <i>Plume</i> therefore, by
the dissimilar Leaves, may have
the advantage likewise of some
refreshment from Dew or Rain.
For these having their Basis a little
beneath that of the <i>Plume</i>,
and expanding themselves on all
sides of it, they often stand after
Rain, like a Vessel of Water, continually
soaking and supplying
it, lest its new access into the Ayr,
should shrivel it.</p>

<p>Moreover, that since the dissimilar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Leaves by their Basis intercept
the <i>Root</i> and <i>Plume</i>, the
greater and grosser part of the
Sap may be by the way deposited
into those; and so the purest proceed
into the yet but young and
delicate <i>Plume</i>, as its fittest Aliment.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have here a demonstration
of the being of the <i>Seminal
Root</i>; which since through
the colour or smallness of the Seed,
it could not by dissection be observ’d,
except in some few; Nature
hath here provided us a way
of viewing it in the now effoliated
Lobes, not of one or two Seeds,
but of hundreds; the <i>Seminal
Root</i> visibly branching it self towards
the Cone and Verges of
the said Lobes, or now dissimilar
Leaves.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAP_II">CHAP. II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Root.</i></span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">Having examin’d and pursu’d
the Degrees of <i>Vegetation</i> in
the <i>Seed</i>, we find its two Lobes
have here their utmost period;
and, that having conveyed their
Seminalities into the <i>Radicle</i> and
into the <i>Plume</i>; these therefore
as the Root and Trunk of the
Plant still survive; Of these in
their order we next proceed to
speak; and first, of the <i>Root</i>:
whereof, as well as of the <i>Seed</i>,
we must by Dissection inform our
selves.</p>

<p>In Dissection of a <i>Root</i> then, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
shall find it with the <i>Radicle</i>, as
the Parts of an old man with
those of a <i>Fœtus</i>, substantially
one. The first Part occurring is
its skin, the Original whereof is
from the Seed: For that extream
thin Cuticle which is spred over
the Lobes of the Seed, and from
thence over the <i>Radicle</i>, upon
the shooting of the <i>Radicle</i> into
a Root, is co-extended, and becomes
its Skin.</p>

<p>The next Part is the <i>Cortical
Body</i>; the Original whereof likewise
is from the Seed; or the <i>Parenchyma</i>,
which is there common
both to the Lobes and <i>Radicle</i>, being
by Vegetation augmented and
prolonged into the <i>Root</i>, is here the
<i>Cortical Body</i>, or that which is
sometimes called the <i>Barque</i>.</p>

<p>The Contexture of this <i>Cortical
Body</i> may be well illustrated by
that of a <i>Sponge</i>, being a Body
Porous, Dilative, and Pliable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Its Pores, as they are innumerable,
so extream small. These
Pores are not only susceptive of so
much Moisture as to fill, but also
to enlarge themselves, and so to
dilate the <i>Cortical Body</i> wherein
they are; which by the shriv’ling
in thereof, by being expos’d to
the Air, is also seen. In which
dilatation many of its Parts becoming
more lax and distant, and
none of them suffering a solution
of their continuity; ’tis a Body
also sufficiently pliable; or, a most
exquisitely fine-wrought Sponge.</p>

<p>The Extention of these Pores
is much alike both by their length
and breadth of the Root; which
from the shrinking up of the <i>Cortical
Body</i>, in a piece of a cut
Root, by the same dimensions, is
argu’d.</p>

<p>The proportions of this <i>Cortical
Body</i> are various: If thin, ’tis
called a <i>Barque</i>; &amp; thought to serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to no other end, than what is usually
ascrib’d to it as a <i>Barque</i>;
which is a narrow conceit: If a
Bulky Body in comparison with
that within it, as in the young
Roots of <i>Cychory</i>, <i>Asparagus</i>, &amp;c.
’tis here, because the fairest, therefore
taken for the prime Part;
which, though, as to Medicinal
use, it is; yet, as to the private
use of the Plant, not so. The
Colour hereof, though it be originally
white, yet in the continued
growth of the Root, divers
Tinctures, as yellow in <i>Dock</i>, red
in <i>Bistort</i>, are thereinto introduced.</p>

<p>Next within this Part stands the
<i>Lignous Body</i>; the Original whereof,
as of the two former, is from
the Seed; or, the <i>Seminal Roots</i>
of both the Lobes, being united in
the <i>Radicle</i>, and with its <i>Parenchyma</i>
co-extended, is here in the
Root the <i>Lignous Body</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The Contexture hereof is, in
many of its parts, much more close
than that of the <i>Cortical</i>; and their
Pores very different: For whereas
those of the <i>Cortical</i> are infinitely
numerous, these of the <i>Lignous</i>
are in comparison, nothing
so. But these, although fewer,
yet are they many of them more
open, fair, and visible: as in a very
thin Slice cut athwart the young
Root of a Tree, and held up against
the Light, is apparent: Yet
not in all equally, in <i>Coran</i>-Tree,
in <i>Goosberry</i>-Tree, <i>&amp;c.</i> less; in <i>Oak</i>,
<i>Plums</i>, and especially <i>Damascens</i>,
more; in <i>Elder</i>, <i>Vines</i>, &amp;c. more
conspicuous. And as they are
different in number and size, so
also (whereon the numerousness
of the Pores of the <i>Cortical Body</i>
principally depends) in their shape.
For whereas those of the <i>Cortical
Body</i> are extended much alike both
by the length and breadth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<i>Root</i>; these of the <i>Lignous</i> are only
by the length; which, especially
in <i>Vines</i> and some other <i>Roots</i>,
is evident. Of these Pores, ’tis
also observable, that although in
all places of the <i>Root</i> they are visible,
yet most fair and open about
the <i>Fibrous Extremities</i> of some
<i>Roots</i> (and in many <i>Roots</i> higher)
where there is no Pith. These
Pores, as they shew in young <i>Roots</i>
of Trees, <a href="#figures2">see in <i>Fig. 6</i>, &amp; <i>7</i></a>.</p>

<p>This <i>Lignous Body</i> lieth with all
its Parts, so far as they are visible,
in a Circle or Ring; yet are there
divers extream small Fibres thence
shooting, usually mixed with the
<i>Cortical Body</i>; and by the somewhat
different colour of the said
<i>Cortical Body</i> where they stand,
may be noted these Fibres; the
<i>Cortical Body</i> and <i>Skin</i> all together,
properly make the <i>Barque</i>.</p>

<p>The proportion betwixt this
<i>Lignous Body</i> and the <i>Cortical</i>, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
various, as was said; yet in this,
constant, <i>sc.</i> that in the fibrous, and
smaller Parts of the <i>Root</i>, the <i>Lignous
Body</i> is not only in compass,
but in quantity the less; running
like a slender Wyer or Nerve
through the other surrounding it.
They stand both together pyramidally,
which is most common to
<i>Infant-Roots</i>, but also to many other.</p>

<p>The next Part observable in the
<i>Root</i>, is the <i>Insertment</i>. The existence
hereof, so far as we can
yet observe, is sometimes in the
<i>Radicle</i> of the Seed it self; I cannot
say alwayes. As to its substantial
nature, we are more certain;
that it is the same with that
of the <i>Parenchyma</i> of the <i>Radicle</i>;
being alwayes at least augmented,
and so, in part, originated from
the <i>Cortical Body</i>, and so, at second
hand, from the said <i>Parenchyma</i>:
For in dissecting a <i>Root</i>, we find,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
that the <i>Cortical Body</i> doth not only
environ the <i>Lignous</i>, but is also
wedg’d, and in many pieces inserted
into it; and that the said
inserted pieces, make not a meer
Indenture, but transmit and shoot
themselves quite through as far as
the Pith; which in a thin Slice cut
athwart the <i>Root</i> as so many lines
drawn from the Circumference towards
the Center, shew themselves.
<a href="#figures2">See <i>Fig. 6</i>, &amp; <i>7</i>.</a></p>

<p>The Pores of the <i>Insertment</i> are
sometimes, at least, extended somewhat
more by the breadth of the
<i>Root</i>, as about the top of the <i>Root</i>
of <i>Borage</i> may be seen; and are
thus different from those of the
<i>Cortical Body</i>, which are extended
by the length and breadth much
alike; and from those of the <i>Lignous</i>,
being only by its length.</p>

<p>The number and size of these
Insertions are various. In <i>Hawthorn</i>,
and some others, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<i>Willows</i>, they are most extream
small; in <i>Cherries</i> and <i>Plums</i>
they are large; and in <i>Damascens</i>
especially, very fairly apparent. In
the <i>Roots</i> of small <i>Plants</i> they are
generally more easily discoverable;
which may lead to the observation
of them in all.</p>

<p>These Insertions, although they
are continuous through both the
length and breadth of the <i>Root</i>;
yet not so in all Parts, but by the
several shootings of the <i>Lignous
Body</i> are frequently intercepted.
For of the <i>Lignous Body</i> it is (here
best) observable, That its several
shootings, betwixt which the <i>Cortical</i>
is inserted, are not throughout
the <i>Root</i> wholly distinct; but
that all along being enarch’d, the
<i>Lignous Body</i>, both in length and
breadth, is thus disposed into
Braces or Osculations. Betwixt
these several shootings of the <i>Lignous
Body</i> thus osculated, the <i>Cortical</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
shooting, and being also osculated
answerably Brace for Brace,
that which I call the <i>Insertment</i>
is fram’d thereof.</p>

<p>These Osculations are so made,
that the Pores of the <i>Lignous Body</i>,
I think, notwithstanding, seldom
run one into another; but, for
the most part, still keep distinct;
in the same manner as some of the
Nerves, though they meet, and
for some space are associated together,
yet ’tis most probable that
none of their Fibres are truly inosculated
here, but only in the Plexures.</p>

<p>These Osculations of the <i>Lignous
Body</i>, and so the interception
of the Insertions of the <i>Cortical</i>,
are not to be observ’d by the traverse
cut of the <i>Root</i>, but by taking
off the <i>Barque</i>, or the <i>Cortical
Body</i>. In the Roots of Trees,
they are generally obscure; but in
Plants, often more distinctly apparent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and especially in a <i>Turnep</i>:
the appearance whereof, the <i>Cortical
Body</i> being stripp’d off, is as a
piece of close-wrought Network,
fill’d up with the Insertions of the
said <i>Cortical Body</i>. <a href="#figures2">See <i>Fig. 8</i>.</a></p>

<p>The next and last distinct Part
of the <i>Root</i> is the <i>Pith</i>. The substantial
nature thereof, is, as was said
of the <i>Insertment</i>, the same likewise
with that of the <i>Parenchyma</i>
of the Seed. And according to
the best observation we have yet
made, ’tis sometimes existent in its
<i>Radicle</i>; in which, the two main
Branches of the Lobes both meeting,
and being osculated together,
are thus dispos’d into one round
Trunk, and so environing part of
the <i>Parenchyma</i>, make thereof a
<i>Pith</i>; as in either the <i>Radicle</i>, or
the young <i>Root</i> of the great <i>Bean</i>
or <i>Lupine</i>, may, I think, be well
seen.</p>

<p>But many times the Original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
hereof is immediately from the
<i>Cortical Body</i>. For in dissection
of divers <i>Roots</i> both of Trees and
Plants, as of <i>Barberry</i> or <i>Mallows</i>,
it is observable, that the <i>Cortical
Body</i> and <i>Pith</i> are both of them
participant of the same Colour; in
the <i>Barberry</i> both of them tinged
yellow, and in <i>Mallows</i> green. In
cutting the smaller Parts of the
Roots of many Plants, as of <i>Borage</i>,
<i>Mallows</i>, <i>Parsley</i>, <i>Columbine</i>,
&amp;c. ’tis also evident, that the <i>Lignous
Body</i> is not there in the least
Concave, but standeth perfectly
in the Center; and that the Insertions
being gradually multiplied
afterwards, the <i>Pith</i> at length,
towards the thicker parts of the
<i>Root</i>, shews and enlarges it self.
Whence it appears, that in all such
<i>Roots</i>, the <i>Pith</i> is not only of the
same substantial nature, and by
the Insertions doth communicate
with the <i>Cortical Body</i>; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
it is also more or less augmented
by it; which is true of the <i>Pith</i>
of all <i>Roots</i>; but is moreover, by
mediation of the said Insertions,
wholly originated from it. The
various appearances of the <i>Insertions</i>
and <i>Pith</i> from the Fibrous
Parts to the top of the <i>Root</i>, <a href="#figures3">see in
<i>Fig. 9</i>, <i>10</i>, <i>11</i>, <i>12</i>, <i>13</i>, <i>14</i></a>. The
Pores of the <i>Lignous Body</i>, entire
in the said Fibrous Parts, are best
seen when they have lain by a
night dry, after cutting.</p>

<p>A farther evidence hereof are
the Proportions betwixt the <i>Cortical
Body</i> and <i>Pith</i>. For as about
the inferiour Parts of the <i>Root</i>,
where the <i>Pith</i> is small, the <i>Cortical
Body</i> is proportionably great;
so about the top, where the <i>Pith</i>
is enlarged, the <i>Cortical Body</i> groweth
proportionably less, <i>sc.</i> because
by its Insertions, ’tis gradually
bestowed into the <i>Pith</i>. Likewise
the peculiar frame of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<i>Roots</i>, wherein besides the <i>Pith</i>,
the <i>Lignous Body</i> being divided
into a double Ring, there is also a
thick Ring, of a white and soft
substance, stands betwixt them;
and is nothing else but the Insertions
of the <i>Cortical Body</i> collected
into the said Ring; but, towards
the top of the Root, being inserted
again, thus maketh a large and
ample <i>Pith</i>; as in <i>Fennel</i>-Roots is
seen.</p>

<p>The Pores of the <i>Pith</i>, as those
of the <i>Cortical Body</i>, are extended
both by the breadth and length of
the <i>Root</i>, much alike; yet are they
more or less of a greater size than
those of the <i>Cortical Body</i>.</p>

<p>The Proportions of the <i>Pith</i>, are
various; in Trees, but small; in
Plants generally, very fair; in
some making by far the greatest
part of the <i>Root</i>; as in a <i>Turnep</i>:
By reason of the wide circumference
whereof, and so the finer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Concoction and Assimilation of its
Sap; that part which in most old
Trunks is a dry and harsh <i>Pith</i>,
here proves a tender pleasant meat.
The parts of a <i>Turnep</i> in the travers
cut <a href="#figures2">see in <i>Fig. 8</i></a>.</p>

<p>In the Roots of very many
Plants, as <i>Turneps</i>, <i>Carrots</i>, &amp;c.
the <i>Lignous Body</i>, besides its main
utmost Ring, hath divers of its
osculated Fibres dispersed throughout
the Body of the <i>Pith</i>; sometimes
all alike, and sometimes
more especially in, or near, its
Center; which Fibres, as they
run towards the top of the <i>Root</i>,
still declining the Center, at last
collaterally strike into its Circumference;
either all of them, or
some few, keeping the Center
still; of these principally the <i>Lignous
Body</i> of the Trunk is often originated.</p>

<p>These Fibres, although they are
so exceeding slender, yet in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
<i>Roots</i>, as in that of <i>Flower-de-liz</i>,
they are visibly concave, each of
them, in their several Cavities also
embosoming a very small <i>Pith</i>; the
sight whereof, the Root being
cut traverse, and laid in a Window
for a day or two to dry, may without
Glasses be obtained. And this
is the general account of the <i>Root</i>;
the declaration of the manner of
its growth, with the use and service
of its several parts, we shall
next endeavour.</p>

<p>We say then, that the <i>Radicle</i>
being impregnate, and shot into
the Moulds, the contiguous moisture,
by the <i>Cortical Body</i>, being
a Body laxe and Spongy, is easily
admitted: Yet not all indiscriminately,
but that which is more adapt
to pass through the surrounding
Cuticle. Which transient
Sap, though it thus becomes fine,
yet is not simple; but a mixture of
Particles, both in respect of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
originally in the Root, and amongst
themselves, somewhat heterogeneous.
And being lodg’d
in the <i>Cortical Body</i> moderately
laxe, and of a Circular form; the
effect will be an easie Fermentation.
The <i>Sap</i> fermenting, a separation
of Parts will follow; some
whereof will be impacted to the
Circumference of the <i>Cortical Body</i>,
whence the Cuticle becomes a
Skin; as we see in the growing of
the Coats of Cheeses, of the Skin
over divers Liquors, and the like.
Whereupon the <i>Sap</i> passing into
the <i>Cortical Body</i>, through this,
as through a <i>Manica Hippocratis</i>,
is still more finely filtred. With
which <i>Sap</i>, the <i>Cortical Body</i> being
dilated as far as its <i>Tone</i>, without
a solution of Continuity will bear;
and the supply of the <i>Sap</i> still renew’d;
and the purest part, as
most apt and ready, recedes, with
its due Tinctures, from the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<i>Cortical Body</i>, to the <i>Lignous</i>.
Which <i>Lignous Body</i> likewise super-inducing
its own proper Tinctures
into the said <i>Sap</i>; ’tis now
to its highest preparation wrought
up, and becomes (as they speak
of that of an Animal) the Vegetative
<i>Ros</i> or <i>Cambium</i>: the noblest
part whereof is at last coagulated
in, and assimilated to the
like substance with the said <i>Lignous
Body</i>. The remainder, though
not united to it, yet tinctur’d therein,
thus retreats, that is, by the
continual appulse of the <i>Sap</i>, is in
part carried off into the <i>Cortical Body</i>
back again, the <i>Sap</i> whereof it
now tinctures into good Aliment:
So that whereas before the <i>Cortical
Body</i> was only relaxed in its Parts,
and so dilated; ’tis now increas’d
in real quantity or number of parts,
and so is truly nourish’d. And the
<i>Cortical Body</i> being saturate with
so much of this Vital <i>Sap</i> as serves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
it self; and the second Remainders
discharged thence to the Skin;
this also is nourish’d and augmented
therewith. So that as in an
<i>Animal Body</i> there is no instauration
or growth of Parts made by the
Bloud only, but the <i>Nervous Liquor</i>
is also thereunto assistant; so
is it here: the <i>Sap</i> prepared in the
<i>Cortical Body</i>, is as the Arterious;
and that part thereof prepared by
the <i>Lignous</i>, is as the <i>Nervous Liquor</i>;
which partly becoming Nutriment
to it self, and partly being
discharged back into the <i>Cortical
Body</i>, and diffusing its Tincture
through the <i>Sap</i> there, that
to the said <i>Cortical Body</i> and <i>Skin</i>,
becomes also true Nutriment, and
so they all now grow.</p>

<p>In which growth, a proportion
in length and breadth is requisite:
which being rated by the benefit
of the Plant, both for firm standing
and sufficient Sap, must therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
principally be in length. And
because it is thus requisite, therefore
by the constitution of one
of its Parts, <i>sc.</i> the <i>Lignous Body</i>,
it is also made necessary. For
the Pores hereof, in that they are
all extended by its length, the
<i>Sap</i> also according to the frame and
site of the said Pores will principally
move; and that way as its <i>Sap</i>
moves, the same way will the generation
of its Parts also proceed;
<i>sc.</i> by its length. And the <i>Lignous
Body</i> first (that is, by a priority
causal) moving in length it self;
the <i>Cortical</i> also moves therewith.
For that which is nourish’d, is extended;
but whatever is extended,
is mov’d; that therefore which
is nourish’d, is mov’d: The <i>Lignous
Body</i> then being first nourish’d,
’tis likewise first mov’d, and
so becomes and carries in it the
Principle of all Vegetative motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
in the <i>Cortical</i>; and so they
both move in length.</p>

<p>Yet as the <i>Lignous Body</i> is the
Principle of Motion in the <i>Cortical</i>;
so the <i>Cortical</i> is the Moderator of
that in the <i>Lignous</i>: As in Animal
Motions, the Principle is from the
Nerves; yet being once given to
the Muscle or Limb, and that moving
proportionably to its structure,
the Nerves also are carried
in the same motion with it. We
suppose therefore, that as the
principal motion of the <i>Lignous
Body</i> is in length, so is its proper
tendency also to ascend: But being
much exceeded both in Compass
and Quantity by the <i>Cortical</i>
as in the smaller parts of the <i>Root</i> it
is; it must needs therefore be
over-born and governed by it;
and so, though not lose its motion,
yet make it that way wherein the
<i>Cortical Body</i> may be more obedient
to it; which will be by descent:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Yet both of them being
sufficiently pliable, they are thus
capable, where the Soyl I may oppose
a direct descent, there to divert
any way where it is more penetrable,
and so to descend obliquely.
For the same reason it
may also be, that though you set
a <i>Bean</i> with the <i>Radicle</i> upward;
yet the <i>Radicle</i>, as it shoots, declining
also gradually, is thus arch’d
in form of an Hook, and so at last
descends. For every declination
from a perpendicular Line, is a
mixed motion betwixt Ascent and
Descent; as that of the <i>Radicle</i> also
is, and so seeming to be dependent
upon the two contrary Tendencies
of the <i>Lignous</i> and <i>Cortical
Bodies</i>. What may be the cause
of those Tendencies (being most
probably external, and perhaps
something of a <i>Magnetisme</i>) is besides
my Task here to enquire.</p>

<p>Now although the <i>Lignous Body</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
by the position and shape of its
Pores, principally groweth in
length; yet will it in some degree
likewise in breadth: For it cannot
be supposed that the purest <i>Sap</i>
is all received into the said Pores;
but that part thereof likewise, staying
about its <i>Superficial parts</i>, is
there tinctur’d and agglutinated to
them. And because these Pores
are prolonged by its length; therefore
is it much more laxe and easily
divisible that way; as in slitting a
Stick, or cleaving of Timber, and
in cutting and hewing them athwart
is also seen. Whence it
comes to pass, that in shooting from
the Center towards the Circumference,
and there finding more
room, its said original Laxity doth
easily in divers places now become
greater, and at length in open
Partments plainly visible. Betwixt
which Partments, the <i>cortical Body</i>,
being bound in on the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
hand, by the surrounding Skin
and Moulds, and pressed upon by
the <i>Lignous</i> on the other, must
needs insert it self, and so move
contrary to it, from the Circumference
towards the Center: where
the said contrary motions continued
as begun, they at last meet,
unite, and either make or augment
the <i>Pith</i>. And thus the <i>Root</i> is
fram’d, and the Skin, the <i>cortical</i>
and <i>Lignous Bodies</i>, so as is said,
hereunto concurrent. We shall
next shew the use of the two other
Parts, <i>sc</i>. the <i>Insertment</i> and <i>Pith</i>;
and first of the <i>Pith</i>.</p>

<p>One true use of the <i>Pith</i> is for
the better Advancement of the
<i>Sap</i>, whereof we shall speak in <a href="#CHAP_III">the
next Chapter</a>. The use we here
observe is for the quicker and
higher Fermentation of the <i>Sap</i>:
For although the Fermentation
made in the <i>Cortical Body</i> was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
subservient to the first Vegetations,
yet those more perfect ones in the
<i>Trunk</i> which after follow, require
a Body more adapted to it, and
that is the <i>Pith</i>; which is so necessary,
as not to be only common to,
but considerably large in the <i>Roots</i>
of most Plants; if not in their inferiour
parts, yet at their tops.
Where though either deriv’d or
amplify’d from the <i>Cortical Body</i>,
yet being by its Insertions only,
we may therefore suppose, as those,
so this, to be more finely constituted.
And being also from its co-arctation,
while inserted, now free;
all its Pores, upon the supply of
the <i>Sap</i>, will more or less be amplified:
Upon which accounts, the
<i>Sap</i> thereinto received, will be
more pure, and its fermentation
therein more active. And as the
<i>Pith</i> is superiour to the <i>Cortical
Body</i> by its Constitution, so by its
Place. For as it thus stands central,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
it hath the <i>Lignous Body</i> surrounding
it. Now as the Skin is
the Fence of the <i>Cortical Body</i>,
and that of the <i>Lignous</i>; so is the
<i>Lignous</i> again a far more preheminent
one unto the <i>Pith</i>; the <i>Sap</i>
being here a brisk Liquor, tunn’d
up as in a wooden Cask.</p>

<p>And as the <i>Pith</i> subserves the
higher Fermentation of the <i>Sap</i>;
so do the Insertions its purer Distribution;
that separation which the
parts of the <i>Sap</i>, by being fermented
in the <i>Pith</i>, were dispos’d for;
being, upon its entrance into the
Insertions, now made: So that
as the Skin is a Filtre to the <i>Cortical
Body</i>, so are the Insertions a
more preheminent one to the <i>Lignous</i>;
and as they subserve the
purer, so the freer and sufficient distribution
of the <i>Sap</i>: For the
<i>Root</i> enlarging, and so the <i>Lignous
Body</i> growing thicker, although
the <i>Cortical</i> and the <i>Pith</i> might supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<i>Sap</i> sufficient to the nutrition
of its Parts next adjacent to them;
yet those more inward, must needs
be scanted of their <i>Aliment</i>; and
so, if not quite starv’d, yet be uncapable
of equal growth: Whereas
the <i>Lignous Body</i> being through
its whole breadth frequently disparted,
and the <i>Cortical Body</i> inserted
through it; the <i>Sap</i> by those
Insertions, as the Blood by the
disseminations of the <i>Arteries</i>, is
freely and sufficiently convey’d to
its intimate Parts, even those which
from either the <i>cortical Body</i> or
the <i>Pith</i> are most remote. Lastly,
as the consequent hereof, they are
thus assistant to the Latitudinal
growth of the <i>Root</i>; as the <i>Lignous
Body</i> to its growth in length;
so these Insertions of the <i>Cortical</i>,
to its better growth in breadth.</p>

<p>Having thus seen the solitary
uses of the Several Parts of the
<i>Root</i>, we shall lastly propound our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Conjectures of that Design whereto
they are all together concurrent,
and that is the Circulation of
the <i>Sap</i>: For the <i>Sap</i> moving through
the <i>cortical Body</i>, towards the <i>Pith</i>,
through the Insertions thereinto,
obtains a pass: Which passage,
the superiour Insertions will not
favour; because the <i>Pith</i> standing
in the same height with them, is
there large, the fermenting and
course of the <i>Sap</i> quick, and so its
opposition strong. But through
the inferiour it will much more easily
enter; because there, through
the smalness of the <i>Pith</i>, the opposition
is little, and through the
shortness of the Insertions, the way
more open. So that though the
<i>Sap</i> may meet with some opposition
even here, yet here meeting with
the least, here it will bestow it
self (feeding the <i>Lignous Body</i> in
its passage) into the <i>Pith</i>. Into
which fresh <i>Sap</i> still entring, this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
yet but crude, will subside: that
first received and so become a Liquor
higher wrought, will more
easily mount upwards; and moving
in the <i>Pith</i>, as in the <i>Arteria
magna</i>, in equal altitude with the
more superiour Insertions; the
most volatile parts of all will still
continue their direct ascent towards
the <i>Trunk</i>. But those of a
middle nature, and, as not apt to
ascend, so being lighter than those
beneath them, not to descend neither;
they will tend from the
<i>Pith</i> towards the Insertions in a
motion betwixt both; through
which Insertions (feeding the <i>Lignous
Body</i> in its passage) it is,
by the next subsequent <i>Sap</i>, discharged
off into the <i>cortical Body</i>,
as into the <i>Vena cava</i>, back again.
Wherein, being still pursu’d by
fresh <i>Sap</i> from the Center, and
more occurring from the Circumference,
towards the inferiour Insertions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
it thus descends; through
which, together with part of the
<i>Sap</i> afresh imbib’d from the Mould,
it re-enters the <i>Pith</i>. From whence,
into the <i>Cortical Body</i>, and from
thence into the <i>Pith</i>, the cruder
part thereof reciprocally is disburs’d;
while the most Volatile,
not needing the help of a Circulation,
more directly ascendeth towards
the <i>Trunk</i>.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_III">CHAP. III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Trunk.</i></span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">Having thus declar’d the degrees
of <i>Vegetation</i> in the
<i>Root</i>; the continuance hereof in
the <i>Trunk</i> shall next be shew’d:
in order to which, the Parts whereof
this likewise is compounded,
we shall first observe.</p>

<p>That which without dissection
shews it self, is the <i>Coarcture</i>: I
cannot say of the <i>Root</i>, nor of the
<i>Trunk</i>; but what I chuse here to
mention, as standing betwixt
them, and so being common to
them both; all their Parts being
here bound in closer together, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in the tops of the grown Roots
of very many Plants, is apparent.</p>

<p>Of the Parts of the <i>Trunk</i>, the
first occurring is its <i>Skin</i>: The Formation
whereof, is not from the
Air, but in the <i>Seed</i>, from whence
it is originated; being the production
of the Cuticle, there investing
the two <i>Lobes</i> and <i>Plume</i>.</p>

<p>The next Part is the <i>Cortical
Body</i>; which here in the <i>Trunk</i> is
no new substantial formation; but,
as is that of the <i>Root</i>, originated
from the <i>Parenchyma</i> of the <i>Seed</i>;
and is only the increase and augmentation
thereof. The <i>Skin</i>,
this <i>Cortical Body</i> properly so call’d,
and (for the most part) some Fibers
of the <i>Lignous</i> mixed herewith,
all together make the
<i>Barque</i>.</p>

<p>Next, the <i>Lignous</i> Body, which,
whether it be visibly divided into
many softer Fibres, as in <i>Fennel</i>,
and most Plants; or that its parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
stand more compact and close,
shewing one hard, firm and solid
piece, as in Trees; it is in all one
and the same Body; and that not
formed originally in the <i>Trunk</i>,
but in the <i>Seed</i>; being nothing
else but the prolongation of the
<i>Inner Body</i> distributed in the
<i>Lobes</i> and <i>Plume</i> thereof.</p>

<p>Lastly, The <i>Insertions</i> and <i>Pith</i>
are here originated likewise from
the <i>Plume</i>, as the same in the <i>Root</i>
from the <i>Radicle</i>: So that as to
their substantial Parts, the <i>Lobes</i>
of the Seed, the <i>Radicle</i> and <i>Plume</i>,
the <i>Root</i> and <i>Trunk</i> are all one.</p>

<p>Yet some things are more fairly
observable in the <i>Trunk</i>. First,
the <i>Latitudinal</i> shootings of the
<i>Lignous Body</i>, which in <i>Trunks</i> of
several years growth, are visible
in so many Rings, as is commonly
known: For several young Fibres
of the <i>Lignous Body</i>, as in the
<i>Root</i>, so here, shooting into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
<i>Cortical</i> one year, and the spaces
betwixt them being after fill’d up
with more (I think not till) the
next, at length they become altogether
a firm compact Ring; the
perfection of one Ring, and the
ground-work of another being
thus made concomitantly.</p>

<p>From these Annual younger Fibres
it is, that although the <i>Cortical
Body</i> and <i>Pith</i> are both of the
same substantial nature, and their
Pores little different; yet whereas
the <i>Pith</i>, which the first year is
green, and of all the Parts the fullest
of <i>Sap</i>, becomes afterwards
white and dry; the <i>Cortical Body</i>,
on the contrary, so long as the
Tree grows, ever keepeth green
and moist, <i>sc.</i> because the said Fibers
annually shoot into, and so
communicate with it.</p>

<p>The Pores likewise of the <i>Lignous
Body</i>, many of them in well-grown
Timber, as in Oaken boards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
are very conspicuous, in cutting
both lengthwise and traverse; they
very seldom run one into another,
but keep, like so many several Vessels,
all along distinct; as by cutting,
and so following any one of
them as far as you please, for a
Foot or half a Yard, or more together,
may be observ’d.</p>

<p>These greater Pores, though in
Wainscot, Tables, and the like,
where they have lain long open,
they are but meer Vacuities, and
so would be thought to contain only
<i>Sap</i> in the Tree, and afterwards
only Air; yet upon a fresh cut,
each of them may be seen fill’d up
with a light and spongie Body,
which by Glasses, and even by the
bare eye, appears to be a perfect
<i>Pith</i>; sometimes entire, and sometimes
more or less broken.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are a lesser
sort; which, by the help of a <i>Microscope</i>,
also appear, if not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
fill’d up with a <i>Pith</i>, yet to contain
certain light and filmy parts, more
or fewer, of a <i>Pithy</i> nature within
them.</p>

<p>And these are all the Pores the
best Glasses, which, (when upon
these Enquiries) we had at hand,
would shew us. But the Learned
and most Ingenious Naturalist
Mr. <i>Hook</i> sheweth us moreover,
besides these, a third, and yet
smaller sort; the description whereof
I find he hath given us amongst
his <i>Microscopical Observations</i>. Of
these Pores (as a confirmation
of what, in <a href="#CHAP_II">the Second Chapter</a>, I
have said of the Pores of the <i>Lignous
Body</i> in general) he also demonstrates;
that they are all continuous
and prolonged by the
length of the <i>Trunk</i>; as are the
greater ones; the Experiment
whereof he imparteth to be, by
filling up, suppose in a piece of
<i>Char-coal</i>, all the said Pores with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
<i>Mercury</i>; which appears to pass
quite through them, in that by a
very good Glass it is visible in their
Orifices at both ends; and without
a Glass, by the weight of the
Coal alone, is also manifest.</p>

<p>Upon farther Enquiry, I likewise
find, that the Pores of the <i>Lignous
Body</i> in the <i>Trunk</i> of Plants,
which at first only supposed, by
the help of good Glasses are very
fairly visible; each Fibre being
perforated by 30, 50, 100, or hundreds
of Pores. Or what I think
is the truest notion of them, that
each Fibre, though it seem to the
bare eye to be but one, yet is indeed
a great number of Fibres together;
every Pore being not
meerly a space betwixt the several
pores of the Wood, but the Concave
of a Fiber: So that if it be
asked, what all that part of a Vegetable,
either Plant or Tree,
which is properly call’d the woody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
part; what all that is, I suppose,
that is nothing else but a Cluster
of innumerable and most extraordinary
small Vessels or concave
Fibres. <a href="#figures1">See <i>Fig. 15</i>.</a></p>

<p>Next the Insertions of the <i>Cortical
Body</i>, which in the <i>Trunk</i> of a
Tree saw’d athwart, are plainly
discerned as they run from the
Circumference toward the Center;
the whole Body of the Tree
being visibly compounded of two
distinct Substances, that of the several
Rings, and that of the Insertions,
running cross; shewing that in
some resemblance in a Plain, which
the Lines of Latitude and of the
Meridian do in a Globe. <a href="#figures1">See
<i>Fig. 16</i>.</a></p>

<p>These Insertions are likewise very
conspicuous in Sawing of Trees
length-wayes into Boards, and
those plain’d, and wrought into
Leaves for Tables, Wainscot,
Trenchers, and the like. In all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
which, as in course Trenchers
made of <i>Beech</i>, and Tables of Oak,
there are many parts which have a
greater smoothness than the rest;
and are so many inserted pieces of
the <i>Cortical Body</i>; which by reason
of those of the <i>Lignous</i>, seem
to be discontinuous; although in
the <i>Trunk</i> they are extended
throughout its Breadth.</p>

<p>These Insertions, although as is
said, of a quite distinct substance
from the <i>Lignous Body</i>, and so no
where truly incorporated with it,
yet being they are in all parts, the
one as the Warp, the other as the
Woof, mutually braced and inter-woven
together, they thus constitute
one strong and firmly coherent
Body.</p>

<p>As the Pores are greater or less,
so are the Insertions also: To the
bare eye usually the greater only
are discernable: But through an
indifferent <i>Microscope</i> there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
others also, much more both numerous
and small, distinctly apparent.
So that, I think, we may observe,
that as the grand <i>Pith</i> of the
<i>Trunk</i> communicates with, and is
augmented by the greater Insertions;
so is the <i>Pith</i> of each greater
Pore originated from the less; and
those (at least) pithy parts in the
Midling Pores, from others still
less; and suppose, that the least
of all are so far intruded into the
smallest Pores, as only just to cause
a kind of roughness on their concave
sides, and no more; to
what end shall be said. <a href="#figures3">See <i>Fig. 17</i>.</a></p>

<p>In none of all these Pores can
we observe any thing which may
have the true nature and use of
Valves, which is easily to admit
that, to which they will by no
means allow a regress. And their
non-existence is enough evident,
from what in <a href="#CHAP_I">the first Chapter</a> we
have said of the <i>Lobes</i> of the <i>Seed</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in whose <i>Seminal Root</i>, were there
any <i>Valves</i>, it could not be, that
by a contrary course of the <i>Sap</i>,
they should ever grow; which
yet, where-ever they turn into
Dissimilar Leaves, they do. Or
if we consider the growth of the
<i>Root</i>, which oftentimes is upward
and downward both at once.</p>

<p>The Insertions here in the <i>Trunk</i>
give us likewise a sight of
the position of their Pores. For
in a plained piece of Oak, as
in Wainscot, Tables, <i>&amp;c.</i> besides
the larger Pores of the <i>Lignous
Body</i>, which run by the length of
the <i>Trunk</i>; the Tract likewise of
those of the Insertions may be observed
to be made by the breadth,
and so directly cross. Nor are they
continuous as those of the <i>Lignous
Body</i>, but very short, as those both
of the <i>Cortical Body</i> and <i>Pith</i>, with
which the Insertions, as to their
substance are congenerous. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
they all stand so together, as to be
plainly ranked in even Lines or
Rows throughout the breadth of
the <i>Trunk</i>: As the Tract of these
Pores appear to the naked Eye, <a href="#figures3">see
in <i>Fig. 18</i></a>. By the best Microscope
I have at hand, I can only observe
the Ranks of the Pores; not the
Pores themselves, saving here and
there one; wherefore I have not
describ’d them.</p>

<p>The Pores of the <i>Pith</i> likewise
being larger here in the <i>Trunk</i>, are
better observable than in the <i>Root</i>:
the width whereof, in comparison
with their sides so exquisitely thin,
may by an Honey-Comb be grosly
exemplified; and is that also which
the vast disproportion betwixt the
Bulk and weight of a dry <i>Pith</i>
doth enough declare. In the <i>Trunks</i>
of some Plants, they are so ample
and transparent, that in cutting
both by the length and breadth of
the <i>Pith</i>, some of them, even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the bare eye would seem to be considerably
extended by the length
of the said <i>Pith</i>; which once I also
thought they were, and that only
the rest of them were but short
and discontinuous, and as ’tis said,
somewhat answerable to the Cells
of an Honey-Comb. This was
the nearest we could come to them,
by conjecture, and the assistance
of the best Glasses we then had by
us, when upon enquiry into the
nature of the <i>Pith:</i> But that
Worthy Person newly mentioned
Mr. <i>Hooke</i> sheweth us, that the
Pores of the <i>Pith</i>, particularly of
<i>Elder-Pith</i>, so far as they are visible,
are all alike discontinuous; and
that the <i>Pith</i> is nothing else (to
use his own words) but an heap
of Bubbles.</p>

<p>Besides what this Observation
informs us of here, it farther confirms
what in <a href="#CHAP_II">the second Chapter</a>
we have said of the Original of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
<i>Pith</i> and <i>Cortical Body</i>, and of the
sameness of both their natures with
the <i>Parenchyma</i> of the Seed. For,
upon farther enquiry with better
Glasses, I find, that the <i>Parenchyma</i>
of the <i>Plume</i> and <i>Radicle</i>, and
even of the <i>Lobes</i> themselves,
though not so apparently, is nothing
else but a Mass of Bubbles.</p>

<p>In the <i>Piths</i> of many Plants, the
greater Pores have some of them
lesser ones within them, and some
of them are divided with cross
Membranes: And betwixt their
several sides, have, I think, other
smaller Pores visibly interjected.
However, that they are all permeable,
is most certain. They stand
together not indeterminately, but
in even Ranks or Trains; as those
of the Insertions by the breadth,
so these by the length of the <i>Trunk</i>.
And thus far there is a general corresponding
betwixt the part of the
<i>Root</i> and <i>Trunk</i>: Yet are there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
some considerable Disparities betwixt
them; wherein, and how
they come to pass, and to what
especial use and end, shall next be
said.</p>

<p>We say then, that the <i>Sap</i> being
in the <i>Root</i> by Filtrations,
Fermentations (and in what <i>Roots</i>
needful, perhaps by Circulation
also) duly prepar’d; the prime
part thereof passing through the
intermediate Coarcture, in due
moderation and purity is entertain’d
at last into the <i>Trunk</i>. And
the <i>Sap</i> of the <i>Trunk</i> being purer
and more volatile, and so it self
apt to ascend; the motion of the
<i>Trunk</i> likewise will be more noble,
receiving a disposition and
tendency to ascend therewith.
And what by the <i>Sap</i> the <i>Trunk</i>
is in part dispos’d to, by the respective
position and quantity of its
Parts it is effectually enabled. For
whereas in the <i>Root</i> the <i>Lignous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Body</i> being in proportion with the
<i>Cortical</i>, but little, and all lying
close within its Center; it must
therefore needs be under its controul:
on the contrary, being here
comparatively of greater quantity,
and also more dilated, and having
divers of its Branches standing
more abroad towards the Circumference,
as both in the Leaves and
Body of the young <i>Trunk</i> and
<i>Plume</i>, is seen; it will in its own
tendency to ascend, reduce the
<i>Cortical Body</i> to a compliance with
it.</p>

<p>And the <i>Trunk</i> thus standing
from under the restraint of the
Mould in the open Air, the disposition
of its Parts originally different
from that of the Parts in the
Root will not only be continued,
but improved: For by the force
and pressure of the <i>Sap</i> in its collateral
Motion, the <i>Lignous Body</i>
will now more freely and farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
be dilated. And this being dilated,
the <i>Cortical Body</i> also, must
needs be inserted; and is therefore
in proportion alwayes more
or less smaller here in the <i>Trunk</i>,
than in the <i>Root</i>. And as the <i>Cortical
Body</i> lessens, so the <i>Pith</i> will
be enlarged, and by the same proportion
is here greater. And the
<i>Pith</i> being enlarged it self, its
Pores (the <i>Lignous Body</i>, upon
its dilatation, as it were tentering
and stretching out all their sides)
must needs likewise be enlarged
with it, and accordingly are ever
greater in the <i>Pith</i> of the <i>Trunk</i>,
than of the <i>Root</i>. And the dilatation
of the <i>Lignous Body</i> still
continued, it follows, that whereas
the <i>Pith</i> descendent in the <i>Root</i>,
is not only in proportion less and
less, but also in the smaller extremities
thereof, and sometimes higher
altogether absent: Contrariwise,
in the <i>Trunk</i> it is not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
continued to its top, but also
there in proportion equally ample
with what it is in any other inferiour
part.</p>

<p>But although the openness of
the Ayr permitting be alwayes alike;
yet the Energy of the <i>Sap</i>
effecting; being different; as
therefore that doth, the dilatation
of the <i>Trunk</i> will also vary. If
that be less, so is this; as in the
<i>Trunks</i> of most Trees: If that be
greater, so is this; as in Plants is
common; the <i>Lignous Body</i> being
usually so far dilated, that the <i>utmost
shootings</i> thereof may easily
be seen to jut out, and adjoyn to
the Skin. And if the <i>Sap</i> be still
of greater energy, it so far dilates
the <i>Lignous Body</i>, as not only to
amplifie the <i>Pith</i> and all its Pores;
but also so far to stretch them out,
as to make them tear. Whereupon
either running again into the
<i>Cortical Body</i>, or shrinking up towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
it, the <i>Trunk</i> thus sometimes
becomes an <i>hollow Stalk</i>, the
<i>Pith</i> being wholly, or in part voyded.
But generally it keeps entire;
and where it doth, the same
proportion and respect to the <i>Lignous</i>
and <i>Cortical Bodies</i>, as is said.
The Consequences of all which
will be, the strength of the <i>Trunk</i>,
the security and plenty of the <i>Sap</i>,
its Fermentation will be quicker,
its Distribution more effectual, and
its Advancement more sufficient.</p>

<p>First, the erect growth and
strength of the <i>Trunk</i>; this being
by the position of its several parts
effected: For besides the slendering
of the <i>Trunk</i> still towards the
top, the Circumferential position
of the <i>Lignous Body</i> likewise is, and
that eminently hereunto subservient:
So that as the <i>Lignous Body</i>
in the smaller part of the <i>Root</i>
standing Central, we may thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
conceive and see their pliableness
to any oblique motion; so here,
on the contrary, the <i>Lignous Body</i>
standing wide, it thus becomes
the strength of the <i>Trunk</i>, and
most advantageous to its perpendicular
growth. We see the same
Design in <i>Bones</i> and <i>Feathers</i>: The
strongest <i>Bones</i>, as those in the
Legs, are hollow. Now should
we suppose the same <i>Bone</i> to be
contracted into a Solid Body, although
now it would be no heavier,
and in that respect, as apt
for motion; yet would it have far
less strength, than as it is dilated
to a Circumferential posture. And
so for <i>Quills</i>, which, for the same
Reasons, in subserviency to flight,
we see how exceeding light they
are, and yet, in comparison with
the thinness of their Body, how
very strong: We see it not only
in Nature, but Art. For hence
it is that <i>Joyners</i> and <i>Carpenters</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
unite and set together their Timber-pieces
and several Works oftentimes
with double Joynts;
which, although they are no thicker
than a single one might be made,
yet standing at a distance, have a
greater strength than that could
have. And the same Architecture
will have the same use in the <i>Trunks</i>
of Plants, in most whereof ’tis very
apparent; as for instance, in
Corn: For Nature designing its
<i>Sap</i> a great Ascent for its higher
maturity, hath given it a tall
<i>Trunk</i>; but to prevent its ravenous
despoiling either of the Ear or
Soyl; although it be tall, yet
are its sides but thin: and because
again, it should grow not only
tall and thriftily, but for avoiding
propping up, strongly too; therefore,
as its height is over-proportioned
to the thinness of its sides,
so is its Circumference also; being
so far dilated as to parallel a <i>Quill</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
it self. Besides the position of
the <i>Lignous Body</i> within the compass
of a Ring, we see some shootings
thereof often standing beyond
the Circumference of the said Ring,
making sometimes a triangular,
oftner a quadrangular Body of the
<i>Trunk</i>; to the end, that the Ring
being but thin, and not self-sufficient,
these, like Splinters to
<i>Bones</i>, might add strength and
stability to it.</p>

<p>Next, the security and plenty
of the <i>Sap</i>. For should the <i>Lignous
Body</i>, as it doth in the <i>Root</i>,
its smaller parts, stand Central
here also, and so the <i>Cortical</i> wholly
surround it: the greater part
of the <i>Sap</i> would thus be more
immediately expos’d to the Sun
and ayr; and being lodg’d in a laxe
Body, by them continually be
prey’d upon, and as fast as supplied
to the <i>Trunk</i>, be exhausted.
Whereas the <i>Pith</i> standing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Center, the <i>Sap</i> therein being not
only most remote from the Ayr
and Sun, but by the <i>Barque</i>, and
especially the <i>Wood</i>, being also
surrounded and doubly immur’d,
will very securely and copiously
be conveyed to all the Collateral
parts, and (as shall be said how)
the top of the <i>Trunk</i>.</p>

<p>And the <i>Sap</i> by the amplitude,
and great porosity of the <i>Pith</i> being
herein more copious, its Fermentation
also will be quicker;
which we see in all Liquors by
standing in a greater quantity together,
proceeds more kindly:
And being tunn’d up within the
<i>Wood</i>, is at the same time not only
secur’d from loss, but all extream
mutations, the Day being thus not
too hot, nor the Night too cold
for it.</p>

<p>And the Fermentation hereof
being quicker, its motion also will
be stronger, and its distribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
more effectual, not only to the
dilatation of the <i>Trunk</i>, but likewise
the shooting out of the Branches.
Whence it is, that in the
Bodies of Trees, the <i>Barque</i> of it
self, though it be sappy, and many
Fibres of the <i>Lignous Body</i> mixed
with it, yet seldom sendeth
forth any; and that in Plants,
those with the least <i>Pith</i> (other
advantages not supplying this defect)
have the fewest or smallest
Branches, or other collateral
Growths: and that <i>Corn</i>, which
hath no <i>Pith</i>, hath neither any
Branches.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Advancement of the
<i>Sap</i> will hence also be more ready
and sufficient. For the understanding
where, and how, we suppose
that in all <i>Trunks</i> whatsoever
there are two parts joyntly hereunto
subservient. In some the <i>Lignous
Body</i> and the <i>Cortical</i>, as in
older <i>Trunks</i>, the <i>Pith</i> being either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
excluded or dried: But in most,
principally the <i>Lignous Body</i> and
<i>Pith</i>; as in most Annual Growths
of Trees; but especially Plants,
where the <i>Cortical Body</i> is usually
much and often wholly inserted.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Lignous</i> body it is so apparent
by its Pores, or rather by
its Vessels, that we need no farther
evidence. For to what end
are Vessels but for the conveyance
of Liquor? And is that also, which
upon cutting the young Branch of
a Sappy Tree or Plant, by an accurate
and steady view may be observed.
But when I say the Pores
of the <i>Lignous Body</i>, I mean principally
them of the younger shootings,
both those which make the
new Ring, and those which are
mixed with the <i>Cortical Body</i> in
the <i>Barque</i>: that which ascendeth
by the Pores of the older Wood,
being probably, because in less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
quantity, more in form of a Vapour,
than a Liquor. Yet that
which drenching into the sides of
its Pores, is with all thereunto sufficient
Aliment; as we see <i>Orpine</i>,
<i>Onions</i>, &amp;c. only standing in
a moyster Ayr will often grow;
And being likewise in part supplied
by the Insertions from the younger
Shoots: But especially, because
as it is but little, so it serveth
only for the growth of the said <i>Older
Wood</i>, and no more; whereas
the more copious Aliment ascendent
by the younger Shoots, subserves
not only their own growth,
but the generation of others; and
is besides with that in the <i>Cortical
Body</i> the Fountain of <i>Perspirations</i>,
which we know even in Animals
are much more abundant than the
<i>Nutritive parts</i>; and doubtless in
a <i>Vegetable</i> are still much more.</p>

<p>But these Pores, although they
are a free and open way to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ascending <i>Sap</i>; yet that meer
Pores or Vessels should be able of
themselves to advance the <i>Sap</i>
with that speed, strength &amp; plenty,
and to that height, as is necessary,
cannot probably be supposed. It
follows then, that herein we must
grant the <i>Pith</i> a joynt service. And
why else in the smaller parts of the
<i>Root</i>, where the <i>Pith</i> is often wanting,
are the Pores there greater?
Why is the <i>Pith</i> in all primitive
growths the most <i>Sappy</i> part, why
hath it so great a stock of <i>Sap</i>, if
not after due maturation within it
self still to be disbursed into the
Fibres of the <i>Lignous Body</i>? Why
are the annual growths of all both
Plants and Trees with great Piths,
the quickest and the longest? But
how are the Pores of the <i>Pith</i> permeable?
That they are so, both
from their being capable of a repletion
with <i>Sap</i>, and of being again
wholly emptied of it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
again, instead thereof fill’d with
Ayr, is as certain as that they are
Pores. That they are permeable,
by the breadth, appears from the
dilatation of the <i>Lignous Body</i>, and
from the production of Branches,
as hath been, and shall hereafter
be said. And how else is
there a Communion betwixt this
and the <i>Cortical Body</i>? That they
are so also, by the length, is probable,
because by the best <i>Microscope</i>
we cannot yet observ, that they are
visibly more open by the breadth,
than by the length. And withal are
ranked by the length, as those of
the Insertions by the breadth of the
<i>Trunk</i>. But if you set a piece of
dry <i>Elder-Pith</i> in some tinged Liquor,
why then doth it not penetrate
the Pores, so as to ascend
through the Body of the <i>Pith</i>? The
plain reason is, because they are all
fill’d with Ayr. Whereas the <i>Pith</i>
in a Vegetating Plant, as its Parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
or Pores are still generated, they
are at the same time also fill’d with
<i>Sap</i>; which, as ’tis gradually spent,
is still repair’d by more succeeding,
and so the Ayr still kept out; as in
all primitive growths, and the <i>Pith</i>
of <i>Elder</i> it self: Yet the same
<i>Pith</i>, by reason of the following
Winter, wanting a more copious
and quick supply of <i>Sap</i>, thus once
become, ever after keeps dry. And
since in the aforesaid Trial the Liquor
only ascends by the sides of
the <i>Pith</i>, that is of its broken
Pores, we should thence by the
same reason conclude that they are
not penetrable by the breadth
neither, and so no way; and then
it need not be ask’d what would
follow. But certainly the <i>Sap</i> in
the Pores of the <i>Pith</i> is discharged
and repaired every moment, as by
its shriv’ling up; upon cutting the
Plant is evident.</p>

<p>We suppose then, that as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<i>Sap</i> ascendeth into the <i>Trunk</i> by
the <i>Lignous Body</i>, so partly also by
the <i>Pith</i>. For a piece of <i>Cotton</i>
with one end immers’d in some tinged
Liquor, and with the other erect
above, though it will not imbibe
the Liquor so far as to over-run
at the top, yet so as to advance
towards it, it will; so here, the
<i>Pith</i> being a porous and spongy
Body, and in its Vegetating state its
Pores also permeable, as a curious
Filtre of Natures own contrivance,
it thus advanceth, or as people
use to say, sucks up the <i>Sap</i>. Yet as
it is seen of the Liquor in the Cotton;
so likewise are we to suppose
it of the <i>Sap</i> in the <i>Pith</i>; that
though it riseth up for some way,
yet is their some term, beyond
which it riseth not, and towards
which the motion of the ascending
<i>Sap</i> is more and more broken, weak
and slow, and so the quantity
thereof less and less. But because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the <i>Sap</i> moveth not only by the
length, but breadth of the <i>Pith</i>;
at the same time therefore as it
partly ascendeth by the <i>Pith</i>, it
is likewise in part pressed into the
<i>Lignous Body</i> or into its Pores.
And since the motion of the <i>Sap</i>
by the breadth of the <i>Pith</i> not being
far continued, and but collateral,
is more prone and easie than
the perpendicular, or by its length;
it therefore follows, that the collateral
motion of the <i>Sap</i>, at such
a height or part of the <i>Pith</i>, will
be equally strong with the perpendicular
at another part, though
somewhat beneath it; and that
where the perpendicular is more
broken and weak, the collateral
will be less; and consequently
where the perpendicular tendency
of the <i>Sap</i> hath its term, the collateral
tendency thereof, and so
its pressure into the Pores of the
<i>Lignous Body</i> will still continue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Through which, in that they are
small, and so their sides almost
contiguous, the <i>Sap</i> as fast as pressed
into them will easily run up; as
betwixt the two halves of a Stick
first slit, and then tied somewhat
loosely together, may also any Liquor
be observed to do. And the
sides of the said Pores being not
smooth, but by the intrusion of
the smallest insertions made somewhat
rough; by that means the
higher and more facile ascent of
the <i>Sap</i> therein will farther be promoted.
By all which Advantages
the facility and strength of that ascent
will be continued higher in
the said Pores than in the <i>Pith</i>.
Yet since this also, as well as that in
the <i>Pith</i> will have its term; the <i>Sap</i>,
although got thus far, would yet
at last be stagnant, or at least its
ascent be very sparing, slow and
feeble, if not some way or other
re-inforced. Wherefore, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
<i>Sap</i> moving by the breadth of the
<i>Pith</i>, presseth thence into the
Pores of the <i>Lignous Body</i>; so having
well fill’d these, is in part by
the same Collateral motion disbursed
back into a yet higher Region
of the <i>Pith</i>. By which partly, and
partly by that portion of the <i>Sap</i>,
which in its perpendicular ascent
was before lodged therein; ’tis thus
here, as in any inferiour place equally
repleat. Whereupon the
force and vigour of the perpendicular
motion of the <i>Sap</i> herein
will likewise be renew’d; and so
its Collateral motion also, and so
its pressure into the Pores of the
<i>Lignous Body</i>, and consequently
its ascent therein; and so by a
pressure from these into the <i>Pith</i>,
and from the <i>Pith</i> into these reciprocally
carried on, a most ready
and copious ascent of the <i>Sap</i> will
be continued from the bottom to
the top, though of the highest
<i>Trunk</i>.</p>

<h3><i>An Appendix.</i><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of Trunk-Roots and Claspers.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap">The distinct Parts whereof these
are constituted, are the same
with those of the <i>Trunk</i>, and but
the continuation of them.</p>

<p><i>Trunk-Roots</i> are of two kinds:
Of the one, are those that vegetate
by a direct descent: The
place of their Eruption is sometimes
all along the <i>Trunk</i>; as in
<i>Mint</i>, &amp;c. Sometimes only at its
utmost point, as in the <i>Bramble</i>.</p>

<p>The other sort are such as neither
ascend nor descend, but shoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
forth at right Angles with the
<i>Trunk</i>; which therefore, though
as to their Office, they are true
<i>Roots</i>, yet as to their Nature, they
area <i>Middle thing</i> betwixt a <i>Root</i>
and a <i>Trunk</i>.</p>

<p><i>Claspers</i>, though they are but of
one kind, yet their nature is double;
not a mean betwixt that of
the <i>Root</i> and that of the <i>Trunk</i>,
but a compound of both; as in
their Circumvolutions, wherein
they often mutually ascend and descend,
is seen.</p>

<p>The use of these Parts may be
observed as the <i>Trunk</i> mounts, or
as it trails. In the mounting of
the <i>Trunk</i>, they are for support
and supply: For support, we see
the <i>Claspers</i> of <i>Vines</i>; the Branches
whereof being very long, fragile
and slender, unless by their
<i>Claspers</i> they were mutually contain’d
together, they must needs
by their own weight, and that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
their Fruit, undecently fall, and
be also liable to frequent breaking.
So that the whole care is divided
betwixt the Gardener and Nature;
the Gardener with his Ligaments
of Leather secures the main Branches;
and Nature with these of
her own finding, secures the less.
Their Conveniency to which end,
is seen in their Circumvolutions, a
motion not proper to any other
Part: As also in their toughness
or strength, though much more
slender than the Branches whereon
they are appendent.</p>

<p>For Supply, we see the <i>Trunk-Roots</i>
of <i>Ivy</i>: For mounting very
high, and being of a closer Constitution
than that of a <i>Vine</i>, the
<i>Sap</i> could not be sufficiently supplied
to the upper Sprouts, unless
these to the <i>Mother-Root</i> were
joyntly assistant. Yet serve they
for support likewise; whence they
shoot out, not as in <i>Cresses</i>, <i>Brook-lime</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
&amp;c. reciprocally on each
side, but commonly all in one;
that so they may be fastened at the
nearest hand.</p>

<p>In the Trailing of the <i>Trunk</i>,
they serve for stabiliment, propagation
and shade. For stabiliment,
we see the <i>Claspers</i> of <i>Cucumbers</i>:
For the <i>Trunk</i> and <i>Branches</i> being
long and fragile, the Brushes of
the Winds would injuriously hoise
them to and fro, to the dammage
both of themselves and their tender
Fruit, were they not by these
Ligaments brought to good Association
and Settlement.</p>

<p>As for this end, so for Propagation,
we see the <i>Trunk-Roots</i> of
<i>Camomile</i>. Whence we have the
reason of the common observation,
that it grows better by being
trod upon: the Mould, where too
laxe, being thus made to lie more
conveniently about the said <i>Trunk-Roots</i>
newly bedded therein; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
is that which we see also effected
in Rowling of <i>Corn</i>.</p>

<p>For both these ends, we see the
<i>Trunk-Roots</i> of <i>Strawberries</i>; as
also for shade; for in that we see
all <i>Strawberries</i> delight; and by
the trailing of the Plant is well
obtain’d: So that as we are wont
to tangle the Twigs of Trees together
to make an <i>Arbour Artificial</i>;
the same is here done to make
a <i>Natural one</i>; as likewise by the
<i>Claspers</i> of <i>Cucumbers</i>: For the
Branches of the one by the Linking
of their <i>Claspers</i>, and of the
other by the Tethering of their
<i>Trunk-Roots</i>, being couched together;
their tender fruits thus lie
under the Umbrage of a <i>Bower</i>
made of their own Leaves.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_IV">CHAP. IV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Germen, Branch, and Leaf.</i></span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The Parts of the <i>Germen</i> and
<i>Branch</i>, are the same with
those of the <i>Trunk</i>; the same <i>Skin</i>,
<i>Cortical</i> and <i>Lignous Bodies</i>, <i>Insertment</i>
and <i>Pith</i>, hereinto propagated,
and distinctly observable
herein.</p>

<p>For upon Enquiry into the Original
of a <i>Branch</i> or <i>Germen</i>, it appears,
That it is not from the <i>Superficies</i>
of the <i>Trunk</i>, but so deep,
as to take with the <i>Cortical</i>, the
<i>Lignous Body</i> into it self; and that
not only from its Circumference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
but (so as to take the <i>Pith</i> in also)
from its <i>Inner</i> or <i>Central parts</i>.
Divers whereof may commonly
be seen to shoot out into the <i>Pith</i>;
from which <i>Shoots</i> the surrounding
and more superiour <i>Germens</i> are originated;
in like manner as the <i>Lignous
Body</i> of the <i>Trunk</i> is sometimes
principally from those Fibrous
<i>Shoots</i> which run along the
<i>Pith</i> in the <i>Root</i>.</p>

<p>The manner wherein usually
the <i>Germen</i> and <i>Branch</i> are fram’d,
is briefly thus: The <i>Sap</i> (as is
said, <a href="#CHAP_III"><i>Chap. 3.</i></a>) mounting in the
<i>Trunk</i>, will not only by its length,
but by its breadth also, through
the <i>Insertions</i> partly move. Yet,
its Particles being not all alike qualified,
in different degrees: Some
are more gross and sluggish; of
which we have the formation of a
Circle of Wood only; or of an
Annual Ring: Others are more
brisk; and by these we have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
<i>Germen</i> propagated. For by the
vigour of their own motion from
the Center, they impress an equal
tendency on some of the inner
parts of the <i>Lignous Body</i> next adjacent
to the <i>Pith</i>, to move with
them. And since the <i>Lignous Body</i>
is not entire, but frequently
disparted; through these dispartments,
the said interiour Parts,
upon their Nutrition, actually
shoot; not only towards the Circumference,
so as to make part of
a Ring, but even beyond it, in
order to the production of a <i>Germen</i>.
And the <i>Lignous Body</i> thus
moving, and carrying the <i>Cortical</i>
along with it; they both make a
force upon the <i>Skin</i>: Yet their
motion being most even and gradual,
that force is such likewise;
not to cause the least breach of
its parts, but gently to carry it on
with themselves; and so partly by
the extension of its already existent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
parts, as of those of Gold in
drawing of Guilded Wyer; and
partly by the accretion of new
ones, as in the enlarging of a Bubble
above the Surface of the Water,
it is extended with them to
their utmost growth. In which
growth, the <i>Germen</i> being prolonged,
and so displaying its several
parts, as when a <i>Prospective</i> or <i>Telescope</i>
is drawn out, thus becomes
a <i>Branch</i>.</p>

<p>The same way as the propagation
of the Parts of a <i>Germen</i> is contriv’d
is its due nutrition also: For
being originated from the inner
part of the <i>Lignous Body</i>, ’tis nourished
with the best fermented <i>Sap</i>
in the <i>Trunk</i>, <i>sc.</i> that next adjacent
to it in the <i>Pith</i>. Besides, since
all its Parts, upon their shooting
forth, divaricate from their perpendicular,
to a cross Line, as
these and the other grow and
thrive together, bind and throng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
each other into a Knot; through
which Knot the <i>Sap</i> being strain’d,
’tis thus in due moderation &amp; purity
delivered up into the Branch.</p>

<p>And for Knots, they are so necessary,
as to be seen not only
where collateral Branches put
forth; but in such Plants also as
shoot up in one single <i>Trunk</i>; as
in <i>Corn</i>; wherein, as they make
for the strength of the <i>Trunk</i>; so
by so many percolations as they are
Knots, for the transmission of the
<i>Sap</i> more and more refined towards
the Ear. So that the two
general uses of Knots are for firmer
standing, and finer growth.</p>

<p>Lastly, as the due Formation
and Nutrition of the <i>Germen</i> are
provided for, so is its security also;
which both in its position upon the
<i>Trunk</i>, and that of its Parts among
themselves may be observed.
The position of its Parts shall
be considered in speaking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Leaf. As to its standing in the
<i>trunk</i>, ’tis alwayes betwixt the
<i>trunk</i> or <i>Elder Branch</i>, and the <i>Basis</i>
of the Stalk of the <i>Leaf</i>; whereby
it is not only guarded from the
Injuries of any contingent Violence,
but also from the more piercing
assaults of the Cold, so long till
in time ’tis grown, as larger, so more
hardy. The manner and uses of
the position of every <i>Germen</i>, considered
as after it becomes a <i>Branch</i>,
hath already been by the Ingenious
Mr. <i>Sharrock</i> very well observed;
to whom I refer.</p>

<p>Upon the prolongation of the
<i>Germen</i> into a <i>Branch</i>, its <i>Leaves</i>
are thus display’d. The Parts
whereof are substantially the same
with those of a <i>Branch</i>: For the
Skin of the Leaf is only the ampliation
of that of the <i>Branch</i>; being
partly by the accretion of new,
&amp; partly the extention of its already
existent parts (dilated as in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of <i>Leaf-Gold</i>) into its present
breadth. The Fibres or Nerves
dispersed through the Leaf, are
only the Ramifications of the
<i>Branch</i>’s Wood, or <i>Lignous Body</i>.
The <i>Parenchyma</i> of the Leaf which
lies betwixt the Nerves, and as in
Gentlewomens Needle-works, fills
all up, is nothing else but the continuations
of the <i>Cortical Body</i>, or
inner part of the <i>Barque</i> from the
<i>Branch</i> into it self, as in most Plants
with a fat Leaf, may easily be seen.</p>

<p>The Fibres of the <i>Leaf</i> neither
shoot out of the <i>Branch</i> nor
<i>Trunk</i>, nor stand in the <i>Stalk</i>,
in an even Line; but alwayes
in either an Angular or Circular
posture, and usually making either
a Triangle, or a Semi-Circle,
or Cord of a Circle; as in <i>Cycory</i>,
<i>Endive</i>, <i>Cabbage</i>, &amp;c. may be observed:
And if the Leaf have but
one main Nerve, that also is postur’d
in a Circular or Lunar Figure;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
as in <i>Mint</i> and others. The
usual number of these Nerves or
Fibres is 3, 5, or 7. See the <i>Figures</i>
from 20, to 29.</p>

<p>The reason of the said Positions
of the Fibres in the <i>Stalk</i> of the
<i>Leaf</i>, is for its more erect growth,
and greater strength; which, were
the position of the said Fibres in
an even Line, and so the Stalk it
self, as well as the Leaf flat, must
needs have been defective; as from
what we have said of the Circumferential
posture of the <i>Lignous Body</i>
in the <i>Trunk</i>, we may better
conceive.</p>

<p>As likewise for the security of
its <i>Sap</i>: For by this means it is,
that the several Fibres, and especially
the main or middle Fibre of
the Leaf, together with a considerable
part of the <i>Cortical Body</i>, are
so disposed of, as to jut out, not
from its upper, but its back, or
nether plain. Whence the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Leaf, reclining backward, becomes
a Canopy to them, defending them
from those Injuries which from
colder Blasts, or an hotter Sun,
they might otherwise sustain. So
that by a mutual benefit, as these
give suck to all the Leaf, so that
again protection to these.</p>

<p>These Fibres are likewise the
immediate visible Cause of the
shape of the Leaf: For if the nethermost
Fibre or Fibres in the
Stalk be in proportion greater, the
Leaf is long, as in <i>Endive</i>, <i>Cycory</i>,
and others: If all of a more equal
size, it spreads rounder, as in <i>Ivy</i>,
<i>Doves-foot</i>, <i>Colts foot</i>, &amp;c. And
although a <i>Dock-Leaf</i> be very long,
whose Fibres notwithstanding, as
they stand higher in the Stalk, are
disposed into a Circle all of an equal
size; yet herein a peculiar fibre,
standing in the Center betwixt
the rest, and running through the
length of the Leaf, may be observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>In correspondence also to the
size and shape of these Fibres, is
the Leaf flat: In that either they
are very small, or if larger, yet
they never make an entire Circle
or Ring; but either half of one, as
in <i>Borage</i>, or at most three parts of
one, as in <i>Mullen</i>, may be seen.
For if either they were so big, as
to contain; or so entire, as perfectly
to include a <i>Pith</i>, the Energy
of the <i>Sap</i> in that <i>Pith</i>, would
cause the said <i>Lignous Ring</i> to shoot
forth on every side, as it doth in
the <i>Root</i> or <i>Trunk</i>: But the said
Fibres being not figur’d into an
entire Ring, but so as to be open;
on that hand therefore where open,
they cannot shoot any thing
directly from themselves, because
there they have nothing to shoot;
and the <i>Sap</i> having also a free vent
through the said opening, against
that part therefore which is thereunto
opposite, it can have no force;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and so neither will they shoot forth
on that hand; and so will they consequently
that way only which the
force of the <i>Sap</i> directs, which is
only on the right and left.</p>

<p>The several Fibres in the Stalk,
are all inosculated in the Leaf, with
very many Sub-divisions; according
as these Fibres are inosculated
near, or at, or shoot directly to
the edge of the Leaf, is it even or
scallop’d. Where these Inosculations
are not made, there we have
no <i>Leaves</i>, but only a company of
<i>Ramulets</i>, as in <i>Fennel</i>.</p>

<p>The Formations and Fouldings
of Leaves have one Date, or are
the contemporary works of Nature;
each Leaf obtaining its distinct
shape, and proper posture
together; both being perfect, not
only in the outer, but Central and
minutest Leaves, which sometimes
are five hundred times smaller than
the outer; both which in the Cautious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
opening of a <i>Germen</i> may be
seen.</p>

<p>Nor is there greater Art in the
Forms, than in the Foulds or Postures
of <i>Leaves</i>; both answerably
varying, as this or that way
they may be most agreeable. Of
the <i>Quincuncial</i> posture, so amply
instanc’d in by the Learned Dr.
<i>Brown</i>, I shall omit to speak. Others
there are, which though not
all so universal, yet equally necessary
where they are; giving two
general advantages to the Leaves,
Elegancy and Security, <i>sc.</i> in taking
up, so far as their Forms will
bear, the least room; and in being
so conveniently couch’d, as to be
capable of receiving protection
from other parts, or of giving it
to one another; as for instance,</p>

<p>First, There is the <i>Plain-Lap</i>,
where the Leaves are all laid
somewhat convexly one over another,
but not plaited; being to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the lengthy, breadth and number of
Leaves most agreeable; as in the
Buds of <i>Pear-tree</i>, <i>Plum-tree</i>, &amp;c.
But where the Leaves are not thick
set, as to stand in the <i>Plain-lap</i>,
there we have the <i>Plicature</i>; as in
<i>Rose-tree</i>, <i>Strawberry</i>, <i>Cinquefoyl</i>,
<i>Burnet</i>, &amp;c. For the Leaves being
here plaited, and so lying in half
their breadth, and divers of them
thus also collaterally set together,
the thickness of them all, and half
their breadth, are much alike dimensions;
by which they stand
more secure within themselves, and
in better consort with other <i>Germen-Growths</i>
in the same Truss. If
the Leaves be much indented or
jagg’d, now we have the same
Duplicature; where there are divers
Plaits in the same Leaf, or
Labels of a Leaf, but in distinct
Sets, a lesser under a greater; as
in <i>Tansey</i>, &amp;c. When the Leaves
stand not collaterally, but single,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and that they are moreover very
broad; then we have the <i>Multiplicature</i>;
as in <i>Gooseberries</i>, <i>Mallows</i>,
&amp;c. the Plaits being not only divers
in the same Leaf, but of the
same set continuant, and so each
Leaf gather’d up in five, seven, or
more Foulds, in the same manner
as our Gentlewomens Fans: Where
either the thickness of the Leaf
will not permit a <i>flat lap</i>, or the
fewness of their number, or the
smallness of their Fibres, will allow
the <i>Rowl</i>, there this may be
observed; which is sometimes
single, as in <i>Bears-Ears</i>; sometimes
double, the two <i>Rowls</i> beginning
at each edge of the Leaf,
and meeting in the middle. Which
again, is either the <i>Fore-Rowl</i>, or
the <i>Back-Rowl</i>. If the Leaf be
design’d to grow long, now we
have the <i>Back-Rowl</i>, as in <i>Docks</i>,
<i>Primroses</i>, &amp;c. For the main Fibres,
and that with a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
part of the <i>Cortical Body</i> standing
prominent from the <i>Back-plain</i> of
the Leaf, they thus stand securely
couch’d up betwixt the two <i>Rowls</i>;
on whose security the growth of
the Leaf in length depends. But
<i>Bears-Ears</i>, <i>Violets</i>, &amp;c. upon contrary
respects, are rowled up inwards.
Lastly, there is the <i>Tre-Rowl</i>,
as in <i>Fern</i>; the <i>Labels</i>
whereof, though all rowled up to
the <i>main Stem</i>, yet could not stand
so firm and secure from the Injuries
either of the Ground or Weather,
unless to the <i>Rowls</i> in breadth, that
by the length were super-induc’d;
the <i>Stalk</i> or <i>main Stem</i> giving the
same protection here, which in other
Plants by the Leaves, or some
particular <i>Mantling</i>, is contriv’d.</p>

<p>For according to the Form and
Foulding of every Leaf or <i>Germen</i>,
is its protection order’d; about six
wayes whereof may be observ’d;
<i>sc.</i> by <i>Leaves</i>, <i>Surfoyles</i>, <i>Interfoyles</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<i>Stalks</i>, <i>Hoods</i> and <i>Mantlings</i>. To
add to what we have above given,
one or two Instances. Every Bud,
besides its proper Leaves, is covered
with divers Leafy <i>Pannicles</i> or
<i>Surfoyls</i>; which, what the Leaves
are to one another, are that to them
all: For not opening except gradually,
they admit not the Weather,
Wet, Sun or Ayr, to approach
the Leaves, except by degrees
respondent, and as they are
leisurely inur’d to bear them. Sometimes,
besides <i>Surfoyls</i>, there are
also many <i>Interfoyls</i> set betwixt the
Leaves, from the Circumference
to the Center of the <i>Bud</i>; as in the
<i>Hasel</i>: For the Fibres of these
Leaves standing out so far from a
plain surface; they would, if not
thus shelter’d, lie too much expos’d
and naked to the Severities of the
Weather. Where none of all the
Protections above-named, are convenient,
there the Membranes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the Leaves by continuation in their
first forming (together with some
Fibres of the <i>Lignous Body</i>) are
drawn out into so many <i>Mantles</i> or
<i>Veins</i>; as in <i>Docks</i>, <i>Snakeweed</i>,
&amp;c. For the Leaves here being
but few, yet each Leaf and its
Stalk being both exceeding long,
at the bottom whereof the next
following Leaf still springs up;
the form and posture of all is such,
as supersedes all the other kinds
of protection, and so each Leaf apart
is provided with a Veil to it
self.</p>

<p>The Uses of the Leaves, I mean
in respect of their service to the
Plant it self, are these; first, for
Protection, which, besides what
they give to one another, they afford
also to the <i>Flower</i> and <i>Fruit</i>:
To the <i>Flower</i> in their Foulds;
that being, for the most part, born
and usher’d into the open Ayr by
the <i>Leaves</i>. To the <i>Fruit</i>, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
afterwards they are display’d, as
in <i>Strawberries</i>, <i>Grapes</i>, <i>Rasps</i>,
<i>Mulberries</i>, &amp;c. On which, and
the like, should the Sun-Beams
immediately strike, especially
while they are young, they would
quite shrivel them up; but being
by the Leaves screened off, they
impress the circumjacent Ayr so far
only as gently to warm the said
Fruits, and so to promote their
Fermentation and Growth. And
accordingly we see, that the Leaves
above-named are exceeding large
in proportion to the <i>Fruits</i>: whereas
in <i>Pear-trees</i>, <i>Apple-trees</i>, &amp;c.
the <i>Fruit</i> being of a solider <i>Parenchyma</i>,
and so not needing the
like protection, are usually equal
with, and often wider in Diameter
than the <i>Leaves</i>.</p>

<p>Another use is for Augmentation;
or, the capacity for the due
spreading and ampliation of a Tree
or Plant, are its Leaves: For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the <i>Lignous Body</i> being divided into
small Fibres, and these running
all along their lax and spongie <i>Parenchyma</i>;
they are thus a Body
fit for the imbibition of <i>Sap</i> and easie
growth. Now the <i>Sap</i> having a
free reception into the Leaves, it
still gives way to the next succeeding
in the <i>Branches</i> and <i>Trunk</i>, and
the voyding of the <i>Sap</i> in these,
for the mounting of that in the
<i>Root</i>, and ingress of that in the
Mould. But were there no Leaves
to make a free reception of <i>Sap</i>, it
must needs be stagnant in all the
parts to the <i>Root</i>, and so the <i>Root</i>
being clogg’d, its fermenting and
other Offices will be voyded, and
so the due growth of the whole.
As in the motion of a Watch, although
the original term thereof
be the Spring, yet the capacity for
its continuance in a due measure
throughout all the Wheels, is the
free and easie motion of the Ballance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, As the Leaves subserve
the more copious advancement, so
the higher purity of the <i>Sap</i>: For
this being well fermented both in
the Root, and in its Ascent through
the <i>Trunk</i>, and so its Parts prepar’d
to a farther separation; the
grosser ones are still deposited into
the Leaves; the more elaborate
and essential only thus supplied
to the <i>Flower</i>, <i>Fruit</i> and <i>Seed</i>, as
their convenient Aliment. Whence
it is, that where the <i>Flowers</i> are
many and large, into which the
more odorous Particles are copiously
receiv’d, the green Leaves
have little or no smell; as those
of <i>Rose-tree</i>, <i>Carnations</i>, <i>French-Marigold</i>,
<i>Wood-bind</i>, <i>Tulips</i>; &amp;c.
But on the contrary, where the
Flowers are none or small, the
green Leaves themselves are likewise
of a strong savour; as those
of <i>Wormwood</i>, <i>Tansie</i>, <i>Baum</i>, <i>Mint</i>,
<i>Rue</i>, <i>Geranium Moschatum</i>, <i>Angelica</i>,
and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="An_Appendix"><i>An Appendix.</i><br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of Thorns, Hairs and
Globulets.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap"><i>Thorns</i> are of two kinds, <i>Lignous</i>
and <i>Cortical</i>. Of the
first are such as those of the <i>Hawthorn</i>,
and are constituted of all
the same substantial Parts whereof
the <i>Germen</i> it self, and in a like
proportion: which also in their
Infancy are set with the resemblances
of divers minute Leaves.
In affinity with these are the <i>Spinets</i>
or <i>Thorny Prickles</i> upon the
Verges and Tops of divers Leaves,
as of <i>Barberry</i>, <i>Holly</i>, <i>Thistle</i>, <i>Furze</i>,
and others; all which I think are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the filamentous extremities of the
<i>Lignous Body</i> sheathed in the <i>Skin</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cortical Thorns</i> are such as those
of the <i>Rasberry</i> Bush, being not,
unless in a most extraordinary small
proportion propagated from the
<i>Lignous Body</i>, but almost wholly
from the <i>Cortical</i> and <i>Skin</i>, or from
the <i>Barque</i>.</p>

<p>The growth of this <i>Thorn</i> may
farther argue what in <a href="#CHAP_II">the Second
Chapter</a> we supposed; <i>sc.</i> That
as the proper tendency of the <i>Lignous
Body</i>, is to ascend, so of the
<i>Cortical</i> to descend. For as the
<i>Lignous Thorn</i>, like other Parts
upon the <i>Trunk</i>, in its growth ascends;
this being almost wholly
<i>Cortical</i>, pointeth downward. The
use of <i>Thorns</i> the very Ingenious
Mr. <i>Sharrock</i> observed.</p>

<p>Upon the Leaves of divers
Plants two Productions shew themselves,
<i>sc.</i> <i>Hairs</i> and <i>Globulets</i>. Of
<i>Hairs</i>, only one kind is taken notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of, although they are various.
Ordinarily they are plain; which
when fine and thick set, as on most
<i>Hairy Buds</i>; or fine and long, as
on those of the <i>Vine</i>, we call them
<i>Down</i>.</p>

<p>But sometimes they are not plain,
but branched out, from the bottom
to the top, reciprocally on every
side, in some resemblance to
a <i>Stags-Horn</i>; as in <i>Mullen</i>. And
sometimes they are <i>Astral</i>, as upon
<i>Lavender</i>, and some other Leaves,
and especially those of <i>Wild Olive</i>;
wherein every <i>Hair</i> rising in one
round entire Basis a little way above
the Surface of the Leaf, is
then disparted. Star-like, into several,
four, five or six points, all
standing at right Angles with the
said perpendicular Basis.</p>

<p>The Uses of Hairs are for Distinction
and Protection. That of
Distinction is but secondary, the
Leaves being grown to a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
size. That of Protection is
the prime, for which they were originally
form’d together with the
Leaves themselves, and whose service
they enjoy in their Infant-estate:
For the <i>Hairs</i> being then
in form of a <i>Down</i>, alwayes very
thick set, thus give that protection
to the Leaves, which their exceeding
tenderness then requires; so
that they seem to be vested with a
Coat of <i>Frieze</i>, or to be kept warm,
like young and dainty Chickens,
in Wooll.</p>

<p><i>Globulets</i> are seen upon <i>Orach</i>,
both Garden and wild; and yet
more plainly on <i>Mercury</i> or <i>Bonus
Henricus</i>. In these, growing almost
upon the whole Plant, and
being very large, they are by all
taken notice of.</p>

<p>But strict Observation discovers,
that these <i>Globulets</i> are the natural
and constant Off-spring of very
many other Plants. Both these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
<i>Globulets</i>, and likewise the diversity
of <i>Hairs</i>, I find the Learned
Mr. <i>Hook</i> hath already observed.
They are of two kinds; <i>Transparent</i>,
as upon the Leaves of <i>Hysop</i>,
<i>Mint</i>, <i>Baume</i>, and many more:
<i>White</i>, as upon those of <i>Germander</i>,
<i>Sage</i>, and others. All which,
though the naked Eye will discover,
yet by the help of Glasses we
may observe most distinctly. The
use of these we suppose the same
with those of the <i>Flower</i>, whereof
we shall speak.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAP_V">CHAP. V.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Flower.</i></span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">We next proceed to the
<i>Flower</i>. The general
Parts whereof are most commonly
three; <i>sc.</i> the <i>Empalement</i>, the <i>Foliation</i>,
and the <i>Attire</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Empalement</i>, whether of one
or more pieces, I call that which is
the utmost part of the <i>Flower</i>, encompassing
the other two. ’Tis
compounded of the three general
Parts, the <i>Skin</i>, the <i>Cortical</i> and
<i>Lignous Bodies</i>; each <i>Empaler</i>
(where there are divers) being as
another little Leaf; as in those of
a <i>Quince-Flower</i>, as oft as they happen
to be overgrown, is well seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
As likewise in the <i>Primrose</i>, with
the green Flower, commonly so
call’d, though by a mistake; for that
which seems to be the <i>Flower</i>, is
only the more flourishing <i>Empalement</i>,
the <i>Flower</i> it self being
white; but the continuation of
all the three aforesaid Parts into
each <i>Empaler</i>, is discoverable, I
think, no where better than in an
<i>Artichoke</i>, which is a true <i>Flower</i>,
and whose <i>Empalers</i> are of that
amplitude, as fairly to shew them
all: As also, that the Original of
the <i>Skin</i> of each <i>Empaler</i> is not distinct
from that of the rest; but to
be all one piece, laid in so many
Plaits or Duplicatures as there are
<i>Empalers</i>, from the outermost to
the inner and most central ones.</p>

<p>The Design of the <i>Empalement</i>,
is to be security and Bands to the
other two Parts of the <i>Flower</i>: To
be their security before its opening,
by intercepting all extremities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of Weather: Afterwards to
be their Bands, and firmly to contain
all their Parts in their due and
most decorous posture; so that a
<i>Flower</i> without its <i>Empalement</i>,
would hang as uncouth and taudry
as a <i>Lady</i> without her <i>Bodies</i>.</p>

<p>Hence we have the reason why
it is various, and sometimes wanting.
Some <i>Flowers</i> have none, as
<i>Tulips</i>; for having a fat and firm
Leaf, and each Leaf likewise
standing on a broad and strong Basis,
they are thus sufficient to themselves.
<i>Carnations</i>, on the contrary,
have not only an <i>Empalement</i>,
but that (for more firmitude)
of one piece: For otherwise, the
foot of each Leaf being very long
and slender, most of them would
be apt to break out of compass;
yet is the top of the <i>Impalement</i> indented
also; that the Indentments,
by being lapp’d over the Leaves
before their expansion, may then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
protect them; and by being spred
under them afterwards, may better
shoulder and prop them up.
And if the feet of the Leaves be
both long and very tender too,
here the <i>Empalement</i> is numerous,
though consisting of several pieces;
yet those in divers Rounds, and all
with a counterchangeable respect
to each other (which also the
Learned Dr. <i>Brown</i> observes) as in
all <i>Knapweeds</i>, and other <i>Flowers</i>;
whereby, how commodious they
are for both the aforesaid ends,
may easily be conceiv’d; and well
enough exemplified by the Scales
of Fishes, whereunto, as to their
position, they have not an unapt
resemblance.</p>

<p>The <i>Foliation</i> also, is of the
same substantial nature with the
green Leaf; the <i>Membrane</i>, <i>Pulp</i>,
and <i>Fibres</i> whereof, being, as
there, so here, but the continuation
of the <i>Skin</i>, the <i>Cortical</i> and
<i>Lignous Bodies</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The Foulds of the <i>Flower</i> or
<i>Foliation</i> are various, as those of
the green Leaf; but some of them
different. The most general are,
First, The <i>Plain Couch</i>, as in <i>Roses</i>,
and many other double <i>Flowers</i>.
then the <i>Concave Couch</i> as in <i>Blattaria
flore albo</i>. Next the <i>Plait</i>,
as in some of the Leaves of <i>Pease-Blooms</i>,
in the Flowers of <i>Coriander</i>,
&amp;c. which is either single, as
in those nam’d; or double, as in
<i>Blew-Bottle</i>, <i>Jacea</i>, and more of
that rank. Next, the <i>Couch</i> and
<i>Plait</i> together in the same Flower,
as in <i>Marigolds</i>, <i>Daisies</i>, and all others
of an agreeing form: where
the first apparent Fould or Composture
of the Leaves is in <i>Couch</i>; but
the Leaves being erect, each likewise
may be seen to lie in a double
<i>Plait</i> within it self. Then the <i>Rowl</i>,
as in the <i>Flowers</i> of <i>Ladies-Bower</i>,
the broad top of each Leaf being
by a double <i>Rowl</i> foulded up inwardly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Next, the <i>Spire</i>, which
it the beginning of a <i>Rowl</i>; and
may be seen in the Flowers of <i>Mallows</i>,
and others. Lastly, the <i>Plait</i>
and <i>Spire</i> together, where the part
analogous to the <i>Foliation</i>, is of
one piece, the <i>Plaits</i> being here
laid, and so carried on by Spiral
Lines to the top of the <i>Flower</i>, as
is in divers, and I think in <i>Convolvulus
Doronici folio</i> more elegantly
seen. The reason of all which
varieties, a comparative consideration
of the several parts of the
<i>Flower</i> may suggest. Ile only mention,
that no <i>Flower</i> that I find, hath
a <i>Back-Rowl</i>, as hath the green
Leaf, for two Reasons; because
its Leaves have not their Fibres
standing out much on their backside,
as the green Leaves have;
and because of its Attire, which it
ever embosomes, and cannot so
well do it by a <i>Back-Rowl</i>.</p>

<p>The usual Protections of <i>Flowers</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
by the Precedents are express’d,
<i>sc.</i> <i>Green Leaves</i> and <i>Empalements</i>.
Some have another more peculiar,
that is a <i>double Vail</i>; as the <i>Spring-Crocus</i>.
For having no <i>Empalement</i>,
and starting up early out of
the Mould, even before its <i>Green
Leaves</i>, and that upon the first opening
of the Spring; lest it should
thus be quite starved, ’tis born swath’d
up in a double Blanket, or with
a pair of Sheets upon its Back.</p>

<p>The Leaves of divers <i>Flowers</i> at
their Basis have an <i>hairy Tuft</i>; by
which <i>Tufts</i> the Concave of the
<i>Empalement</i> is fill’d up; that, being
very choice and tender, they may
thus be kept in a gentle and constant
warmth, as most convenient
for them.</p>

<p>The Leaves of the <i>Flower</i>, though
they are not hairy all over, yet in
some particular parts they are often
set with a fine Downy Velvet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
that, being by their shape and posture
in those parts contiguous to
their delicate and tender Attire,
they may thus give it a more softly
and warmer touch. Thus in
the Flower of <i>Ladies Bower</i>, those
parts of its Leaves which rowl inward,
and lie contiguous to the
Attire, are Downy; whereas the
other parts are plain and smooth:
So the Flowers of <i>Pease</i>, <i>Spanish
Broom</i>, <i>Toad-Flax</i>, and many others,
where contiguous to their
Attires, are deck’d with the like
<i>Hairy Velvet</i>.</p>

<p>As upon the Green Leaves, so
upon the Flowers are <i>Globulets</i>
sometimes seen; as upon the backside
of that of <i>Enula</i>. On none
more plainly than that kind of
<i>Blattaria</i> with the white Flower;
where they are all transparent, and
growing both on the Stalk and
Leaves of the <i>Flower</i>, each shewing
likewise its <i>Peduncle</i> whereon it is
erected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The use of the <i>Flower</i>, or the
<i>Foliation</i> whereof we now speak,
(that is, as to its private service) is
for the protection of the Attire;
this, as its under, and the <i>Empalement</i>
as its upper Garments; as
likewise of the <i>Fruit</i>: The necessity
of which Service, in some
Cases, by the different situation of
the <i>Flower</i> and <i>Fruit</i>, with respect
to each other, is evident; <i>Apples</i>,
<i>Pears</i>, and several other <i>Fruits</i>,
standing behind or under the
<i>Flower</i>; but <i>Cherries</i>, <i>Apricots</i>, and
divers others, within it; for these,
being of a very tender and pulpous
Body, and withal putting forth
with the colder part of the Spring,
could not weather it out against
the Variations and Extremities of
the Air, (as those of a more solid
<i>Parenchyma</i> can) except lodged
up within their <i>Flowers</i>.</p>

<p>And as the <i>Flower</i> is serviceable
to the safety of the <i>Fruit</i>, so is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to its growth; <i>sc.</i> in its Infancy, or
<i>Embryo</i>-estate; for which purpose,
as there is a Flower, so that Flower
is greater or less, according as
the nature of the Fruit to which it
belongs, and the plenty of the <i>Sap</i>
by which the Fruit is fed, doth require.
Thus, where the young
Fruit is of a solider constitution,
and the ascent of the <i>Sap</i> less copious,
were there here no <i>Flower</i>
to promote the said ascent thereof
into the Fruit (in the manner as is
effected by the Green Leaves) it
must needs pine and die, or prove
less kindly. On the contrary,
should the Flower be over-large, it
would not only promote the ascent
of the <i>Sap</i> up to the Fruit, but being
as yet over-proportionate to
it, would likewise it self exhaust
the same <i>Sap</i>, as fast as ascendent;
like a greedy Nurse, that prepares
the Meat for her Child, and then
eats it up her self. Thus we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<i>Apples</i> and <i>Pears</i> with a <i>Flower</i> of a
moderate size, like their Body; of
a middle Constitution, and their
<i>Sap</i> of a middle quantity: But
<i>Quinces</i>, being more solid, besides
that they have as great a <i>Flower</i>,
the <i>Impalers</i> of their <i>Flower</i> also
thrive so far as to become handsom
Leaves, continuing also after the
<i>Flower</i> is fallen, firm and verdent
a great while; so long till the <i>fruit</i>
be able to provide for it self. On
the other hand, <i>Plums</i> being more
tender and Sappy than <i>Apples</i> and
<i>Pears</i>, besides that their <i>Empalers</i>
are much alike, their <i>flower</i> is less,
and <i>Gooseberries</i> and <i>Currans</i>, which
are still more Pulpy, and the course
of the <i>Sap</i> towards them more
free, have yet a <i>flower</i> far less. And
<i>Grapes</i>, whose <i>Sap</i> is still of quicker
Ascent, have scarce any <i>flower</i>
at all; only some small resemblance
thereof, serving just upon the setting
of the <i>fruit</i>, and no longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Attire</i> I find to be of two
kinds, <i>Seminie</i> and <i>Florie</i>: That
which I call <i>Seminie</i>, is made up
of two general parts, <i>Chives</i> and
<i>Semets</i>, one upon each <i>Chive</i>. These
<i>Semets</i> have the appearance (especially
in many <i>flowers</i>) of so many
little <i>Seeds</i>; but are quite another
kind of Body: For upon enquiry
we find, that these <i>Semets</i>, though
they seem to be solid, and for
some time after their first formation,
are entire; yet are they really
hollow; and their side, or sides,
which were at first entire, at length
crack asunder: And that moreover
the Concave of each <i>Semet</i> is
not a meer vacuity, but fill’d up
with a number of minute Particles,
in form of a Powder; which,
though common to all <i>Semets</i>, yet
in some, and particularly those of
a <i>Tulip</i>, being larger, is more distinctly
observable.</p>

<p>These <i>Semets</i> are sometimes fastned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
so, as to stand erect above
their <i>Chive</i>, as those of <i>Larks-heel</i>.
Sometimes, and I think usually, so
as to hang a little down, in the
manner and figure of a <i>Kidney</i>;
as in <i>Mallows</i>. Their Cleft or Crack
is sometimes single, but for the
most part double: At these Clefts
it is that they disburse their Powders;
which as they start out, and
stand betwixt the two Lips of each
Cleft, have some resemblance to
the common Sculpture of a <i>Pomegranate</i>
with its Seeds looking out
at the Clefts of its <i>Rind</i>: This
must be observ’d when the Clefts
are recently made, which usually
is before the expansion of the
<i>Flower</i>.</p>

<p>The Particles of these Powders,
though like those of Meal or other
Dust, they appear not easily to
have any regular shape; yet upon
strict observation, especially with
the assistance of an indifferent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Glass, it doth appear, that they
are nothing else but a <i>Congeries</i>
of so many perfect <i>Globes</i> or <i>Globulets</i>:
That which obscures them;
is their being so small. In <i>Dogs-Mercury</i>,
<i>Borage</i>, and very many
more Plants, they are extreamly so.
In <i>Mallows</i>, and some others, more
fairly visible.</p>

<p>Some of these Powders are yellow,
as in <i>Dogs-Mercury</i>, <i>Goats-Rue</i>,
&amp;c. and some of other colours:
But most of them I think
are white; and those of yellow
<i>Henbane</i> very elegant; the disburs’d
Powders whereof, to the naked
eye, are white as Snow; but
each <i>Globulet</i>, through a Glass,
transparent as Crystal; which is
not a fallacy from the Glass, but
what we see in all transparent Bodies
whatsoever, lying in a Powder
or small Particles together.</p>

<p>The <i>Florid Attire</i>, is commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
known by the blind and rude
Name of <i>Thrums</i>; as in the Flowers
of <i>Marigold</i>, <i>Tansie</i>, &amp;c. How
adequate its imposition is, observation
will determine: For the
several <i>Thrums</i> or rather <i>Suits</i>,
whereof the <i>Attire</i> is made up,
however else they may differ in
various Flowers, in this agree,
that they are ever consistent of
more than one, sometimes of two,
and for the most part of three
pieces (for which I call them <i>Suits</i>)
and each piece of a different, but
agreeable and comely form.</p>

<p>The <i>outer part</i> of every <i>Suit</i>, is
its <i>Floret</i>: whose <i>Body</i> or <i>Tube</i> is
divided at the top (like that of
the <i>Cowslip</i>) into divers distinct
Leaves; so that a <i>Floret</i> is the Epitome
of a <i>flower</i>; and is all the
<i>flower</i> that many Plants, as <i>Mugwort</i>,
<i>Tansie</i>, and others, have.
What the Learned Dr. <i>Brown</i> observeth
of the number Five as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the Leaves of the <i>flower</i>, is still
more universally holding in these
of the <i>Floret</i>.</p>

<p>Upon the Expansion of the
<i>Floret</i>, the next part of the <i>Suit</i>
is from within its <i>Tube</i> brought to
sight; which we may (with respect
to that within it) call the
<i>Sheath</i>: For this also, like the
<i>Floret</i>, is a concave Body; in its
shape very well resembling the Fistulous
Pouches of <i>Wake-Robin</i>, or
of <i>Dragon</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Sheath</i>, after some time,
dividing at the top, from within
its Concave, the third and innermost
part of the <i>suit</i>, <i>sc.</i> the <i>Blade</i>
advanceth and displayes it self.
This part is not hollow, as the other
two, but solid; yet at its
point, not originally, but after
some time, is evermore divided into
two halves.</p>

<p>Upon the division of the said
Point, there appears, as upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
opening of a <i>Semet</i>; a Powder of
<i>Globulets</i>, which before lay enclosed
up within its Clefts; and are of
the same nature with those of a <i>Semet</i>,
though not so copious: So
that all <i>flowers</i> have their <i>Powders</i>
or <i>Globulets</i>. The whole <i>Attire</i>
may in <i>Knapweed</i>, <i>Blewbottle</i>, &amp;c.
be observed.</p>

<p>The use of the <i>Attire</i>, how contemptibly
soever we may look upon
it, is certainly great. And
though for our own use we value
the Leaves of the <i>Flower</i>, or the
<i>Foliation</i>, most; yet of all the three
Parts, this in some respects is the
choycest, as for whose sake and
service the other two are made.
The use hereof, as to Ornament
and Distinction, is unquestionable,
but is not all. As for Distinction,
though by the help of
Glasses we may make it to extend
far; yet in a passant view, which
is all we usually make, we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
so well. As for Ornament, and
particularly in reference to the <i>Semets</i>,
we may ask, If for that meerly
these were meant, then why
should they be so made as to break
open, or to contain any thing within
them? Since their Beauty would
be as good as if they were not hollow,
and is better before they
crack and burst open, than afterwards.</p>

<p>A farther use hereof therefore
we must acknowledge, and may
observe; and that is for food; for
Ornament and Distinction to us,
and for Food to other Animals. I
will not say, but that it may serve
even to these for Distinction too,
that they may be able to know one
Plant from another, and in their
flight or progress settle where they
like best; and that therefore the
varieties of these small parts are
many, and well observed by them,
which we take no notice of: Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the finding out of Food is but in
order to enjoy it: Which, that
it is provided for a vast number of
little Animals in the <i>attires</i> of all
<i>Flowers</i>, observation perswades us
to believe. For why else are they
evermore here found? Go from
one Flower to another, great and
small, you shall meet with none
untaken up with these Guests. In
some, and particularly the <i>Sun-flower</i>,
where the parts of the <i>Attire</i>,
and the <i>animals</i> for which they
provide, are larger, the matter is
more visible. We must not think,
that God Almighty hath left any
of the whole Family of his Creatures
unprovided for; but as the
Great Master, some where or other
carveth out to all; and that
for a great number of these little
Folk, He hath stored up their
peculiar provisions in the <i>Attires</i>
of <i>Flowers</i>; each <i>Flower</i> thus becoming
their Lodging and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Dining-Room, both in one.</p>

<p>Wherein the particular parts of
the <i>Attire</i> may be more distinctly
serviceable, this to one Animal,
and that to another, I cannot say:
Or to the same Animal, as a <i>Bee</i>,
whether this for the <i>Honey</i>, another
for their <i>Bread</i>, a third for
the <i>Wax</i>: Or whether all only
suck from hence some <i>Juice</i>; or
some may not also carry some of
the Parts, as of the <i>Globulets</i>,
wholly away: Or lastly, what
may be the primary and private
use of the <i>attire</i> (for even this abovesaid;
though great, yet is but
secondary) I now determine not.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_VI">CHAP. VI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Fruit.</i></span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">The general composition of all
<i>Fruits</i> is one, that is, their
<i>Essential</i> and truly <i>Vital Parts</i>, are
in all the same, and but the continuation
of those which in the other
Parts of a <i>Vegetable</i>, we have already
observed: Yet because by
the different Constitutions and
Tinctures of these Parts, divers
considerably different Fruits result;
I shall therefore take a particular
view of the more known and principal
of them, <i>sc.</i> <i>Apples</i>, <i>Pears</i>,
<i>Plums</i>, <i>Nuts</i> and <i>Berries</i>.</p>

<p>An <i>Apple</i>, if cut traverse, appears
constituted of four distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Parts, the <i>Pill</i>, the <i>Parenchyma</i>,
<i>Branchery</i> and <i>Coare</i>. The <i>Pill</i> is
only the spreading and dilatation
of the skin, or utmost part of the
Barque in the Branch. The <i>Parenchyma</i>,
when full ripe, is a tender
delicate Meat: Yet as the <i>Pill</i>
is but the continuation of the utmost
part of the <i>Barque</i>; so is this
but the continuance and ampliation,
or (as I may call it) the
swelth and superbience of the <i>Inner
part</i> thereof; which upon observation
of a young and Infant-<i>Apple</i>
especially, is evident. Thus
we see the <i>Pith</i>, which is often
tough, in many Roots, as <i>Parsneps</i>,
<i>Turneps</i>, &amp;c. is tender and edible.
So here, the <i>Parenchyma</i>, though
originally no more than the
<i>Barque</i>, yet the plenty and purity
of its <i>Sap</i> being likewise effectual
to the fulness and fineness of its
growth, it thus becomes a soft and
tender meat. The <i>Branchery</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
nothing else but the Ramifications
of the <i>Lignous Body</i> throughout
all the parts of the <i>Parenchyma</i>;
the greater Branches being likewise
by the <i>Inosculations</i> of the
less (as in the Leaf) united together.
The main Branches are usually
fifteen; ten are spred and distributed
through the <i>Parenchyma</i>,
all enarching themselves towards
the <i>Cork</i> or <i>Stool</i> of the <i>Flower</i>;
the other five running from the
<i>Stalk</i> in a directer Line, at last
meet the former at the said <i>Cork</i>,
and are there osculated with them.
These five are originated from one;
which running along the Center of
the <i>Stalk</i>, and part of the <i>Parenchyma</i>
of the <i>Fruit</i>, is therein at
last divided. To these the Coats
of the <i>Kernels</i> are fastned; so that
whereas these Branches were originally
all extended even beyond
the <i>Fruit</i>, and inserted into the
<i>Flower</i> for the due growth thereof;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the <i>Fruit</i> afterwards growing to
some head, and so intercepting and
preying upon the Aliment of the
<i>Flower</i>, starves that, and therefrom
supersedes the service of the
said Branches to it self, ten for its
<i>Parenchyma</i>, and five for its <i>Seed</i>.
The <i>Coar</i> is originated from the
<i>Pith</i>; for the <i>Sap</i> finding room
enough in the <i>Parenchyma</i>, through
which to dispence it self all abroad,
quits the <i>Pith</i>, which thereby hardens
into a <i>Coar</i>. Thus we see the
<i>Insertions</i>, although originate from
the <i>Cortical Body</i>, yet their Parts
being, by the <i>Inosculations</i> of the
<i>Lignous</i>, so much compress’d and
made to co-incide together, they
become a Body very compact and
dense. And in the <i>Barque</i> we see
the same effect by <i>arefaction</i> only,
or a meer <i>voydance</i> of the <i>Sap</i>;
the <i>Inner Part</i> whereof, though
soft and sappy, yet its superficial
<i>Rind</i> is often so hard and smooth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that it may be fairly writ upon.</p>

<p>In a <i>Pear</i> there are five distinct
Parts, the <i>Pill</i>, the <i>Parenchyma</i>,
<i>Branchery</i>, <i>Calculary</i> and <i>Acetary</i>.
The three former are here and in
an <i>Apple</i> much alike; saving that
here the <i>Inner</i> or <i>Seed-Branches</i>
are ordinarily ten. The <i>Calculary</i>
(most observable in rough-tasted,
or <i>Choak-Pears</i>) is a <i>congeries</i> of
little stony Knots: They are many
of them dispersed throughout
the whole <i>Parenchyma</i>; but lying
more continuous and compact together
towards the Center of the
<i>Pear</i>, surround the <i>Acetary</i> there
in a somewhat Globular Form. About
the <i>Stalk</i> they stand more distant;
but towards the <i>Cork</i> or
<i>Stool</i> of the <i>Flower</i>, they still grow
closer, and there at last gather (almost)
into the firmitude of a <i>Plum-stone</i>
it self. Within this lies the
<i>Acetary</i>; ’tis of a soure tast, and
by the bounding of the <i>Calculary</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of a <i>Globular Figure</i>. ’Tis a simple
Body, having neither any of the
<i>Lignous</i> branched in it, nor any
Knots. It is of the same substantial
nature with the <i>Parenchyma</i>;
but whether it be absolutely one
with it, or be derived immediately
from the <i>Pith</i>, my Enquiries yet
made, determine not.</p>

<p>The Original of the <i>Calculary</i>
I seem to have neglected: But
hereof we may here best say, that
whereas all the other Parts are Essential
and truly <i>Vital</i>, the <i>Calculary</i>
is not; but that the several
Knots whereof it consists, are only
so many meer Concretions or
Precipitations out of the <i>Sap</i>; as
in <i>Urines</i>, <i>Wines</i>, and other <i>Liquors</i>,
we often see. And that
this <i>Precipitation</i> is made by the
mixture and re-action of the Tinctures
of the <i>Lignous</i> and <i>Cortical
Bodies</i> upon each other: Even as
all <i>Vegetable Nutrition</i> or <i>Fixation</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of Parts is also made by the joynt
efficiency of the two same Tinctures,
as hath been said. Hence
we find, that as the <i>Acetary</i> hath
no Branches of the <i>Lignous Body</i>,
so neither hath it any Knots. Hence
likewise it is, that we have so different
and contrary a taste in the
<i>Parenchyma</i> beyond the <i>Calculary</i>,
from that in the <i>Acetary</i>; for
whereas this is soure, that, wherein
the said <i>Precipitations</i> are made,
is sweet; being much alike effect,
to what we find in mixing; of <i>Corals</i>,
&amp;c. with <i>Vinegar</i> or other <i>acid
Liquor</i>.</p>

<p>In a <i>Plum</i> (to which the <i>Cherry</i>,
<i>Apricot</i>, <i>Peach</i>, <i>Walnut</i>, &amp;c. ought
to be referr’d) there are four distinct
Parts, the <i>Pill</i>, the <i>Parenchyma</i>,
<i>Branchery</i> and <i>Stone</i>. The
<i>Pill</i> and <i>Parenchyma</i> are, as to
their Original, with those of an
<i>Apple</i> or <i>Pear</i> both alike: As likewise
the <i>Branchery</i>, but differently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
ramified. In <i>Plums</i> (I suppose
all) there are five main <i>Out-Branches</i>,
which run along the
Surface of the <i>Stone</i> from the <i>Basis</i>
to the point thereof, four of them
by the one Ridge, and one by the
other opposite to it. In an <i>Apricot</i>
there is the same number, but
the single Branch runs not upon
the Surface, but through the Body
of the <i>Stone</i>. There are likewise
two or three smaller Branches,
which run in like manner under the
other Ridge for some space, and
then advancing into the <i>Parenchyma</i>,
therein disperse themselves:
These latter sort in <i>Peaches</i> are numerous
throughout: But notwithstanding
the different disposition
of the Branches of the <i>Fruits</i>
aforesaid; yet is there one Branch
dispos’d in one and the same manner
in them all: The entrance
hereof into the <i>Stone</i> is at its <i>Basis</i>;
from whence running through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
its Body, and still inclining or arching
it self towards its Concave,
is at last about its Cone thereinto
emergent, where the Coats of the
<i>Seed</i> are appendent to it. Of the
<i>Seed-Branch</i> ’tis therefore observable
that after its entrance into the
<i>Fruit</i>, ’tis alwaies prolonged therein
to a considerable length; as is
seen not only in <i>Apples</i>, &amp;c. where
the <i>Seed</i> stands a good distance
from the <i>Stalk</i>; but in <i>Plums</i> likewise,
where it stands very near it;
in that here the <i>Seed-Branch</i>, as is
said, never strikes through the
<i>Stone</i> into the Coats of the <i>Seed</i>
directly, but about its Cone or remoter
end. The <i>Stone</i>, though it
seem a simple Body, yet it is compounded
of different ones: The
Inner Part thereof, as it is by far
the thinnest, so is it the most dense,
white, smooth and simple. The
Original is from the <i>Pith</i>; difficult,
but curious to observe: For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
<i>Seed-Branch</i>, not striking directly
and immediately quite through the
<i>Basis</i> of the <i>Stone</i>, but in the manner
as is above described, carries a
considerable part of the <i>Pith</i>, now
gathered round about it, as its <i>Parenchyma</i>,
along with it self, which,
upon its entrance into the concave
of the <i>Stone</i> about its farther end,
is there in part spred all over it, as
the Lining thereof. The outer
and very much thicker Part consisteth
partly of the like <i>Precipitations</i>
or concrete Particles, as in a
<i>Pear</i>, being gathered here much
more closely, not only to a Contiguity,
but a coalition into one
entire Stone; as we see in <i>Pears</i>
themselves, especially towards the
<i>Cork</i>, they gather into the like
Stoniness; or as we see a <i>Stone</i>,
<i>Mineral</i> or <i>Animal</i>, oftentimes the
product of accumulated <i>Gravel</i>:
But as the <i>Parenchyma</i> is mixed
with the Concretion in the <i>Calculary</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
so is it also, though not visibly,
with these in the <i>Stone</i>, the
ground of the <i>Stone</i> being indeed
a perfect <i>Parenchyma</i>; but by the
said Concretions so far alter’d, as
to become dry, hard and undistinguishable
from them.</p>

<p>In a <i>Nut</i> (to which an <i>Achorn</i>
is analogous) there are three general
Parts, the <i>Cap</i>, <i>Shell</i> and <i>Pith</i>.
The <i>Cap</i> is constituted of a <i>Pill</i>
and <i>Parenchyma</i> derived from the
<i>Barque</i>, and <i>Ramulets</i> from the
<i>Lignous Body</i> of the <i>Branch</i>. The
<i>Shell</i> likewise is not one simple
Body, but compounded. The
Superficial Part thereof is originated
from the <i>Pill</i> or <i>Skin</i> of the
<i>Cap</i>, from the inside whereof it is
in a Duplicature produc’d and
spred over the <i>shell</i>: which, if
you look at the <i>Basis</i> of the <i>shell</i>,
is farther evident; for that being
continuous with the <i>Parenchyma</i> of
the <i>Cap</i>, without the interposure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of the <i>Skin</i>, the said superficial
Part is there wanting. The thicker
and inner part of the <i>shell</i> consisteth
of the same <i>Parenchyma</i> as
that of the <i>Cap</i>, with a <i>congeries</i>
of <i>Precipitations</i> filled up, as in a
Stone. And as the <i>Lignous Body</i>
is branched in a Stone, so, with
some difference, in a Shell. The
<i>Outer Branches</i> or <i>Ramulets</i> are numerous,
each issuing out of the
<i>Parenchyma</i> of the <i>cap</i>, and entring
the <i>Shell</i> at the Circumference of
its <i>Basis</i> and so running betwixt
its superficial and inner parts towards
its <i>cone</i>, in a Round. The
<i>Inner</i> or <i>Seed-Branch</i> is single, entering
in, as do the other, at
the <i>Basis</i> of the <i>shell</i>, but at the <i>center</i>
thereof; from whence it runs,
not through the <i>Shell</i>, as in <i>Plums</i>
through the <i>Stone</i>; but through
the <i>Pith</i>, as far as the <i>cone</i>, where
the Coats of the <i>Seed</i> hang appendent
to it. The <i>Pith</i>, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
derived from the same part both
in name and nature in the <i>Branch</i>
and <i>Stalk</i>, or from the <i>Cortical Body</i>,
I yet determine not.</p>

<p>A <i>Berry</i>, as a <i>Gooseberry</i> (to
which <i>Currans</i>, <i>Grapes</i>, <i>Hipps</i>, &amp;c.
are to be referr’d) consisteth, besides
the <i>Seed</i>, of the three general
Parts, <i>Pill</i>, <i>Parenchyma</i> and
<i>Branchery</i>: The <i>Pill</i> is originated
as in the foregoing Fruits. The
<i>Parenchyma</i> is double, as likewise
in some other <i>Berries</i>: The <i>outer</i>
is commonly, together with the
<i>Pill</i>, call’d the <i>Skin</i>, and is that
part we spit out, being of a soure
taste. As the <i>Pill</i> is originated
from the <i>outer</i>, so this from the
<i>inner part</i> of the <i>Barque</i>; and accordingly
the Pores thereof may
be observed plainly of a like shape
with those both of the <i>Cortical Body</i>
and <i>Pith</i>. The <i>inner</i> is of a sweet
taste, and is the part we eat: It is
of a constitution so laxe and tender,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
as it would seem to be only a
thicker or jellied Juice; although
this likewise be a true <i>Parenchyma</i>,
something like that of an <i>Orange</i>
or <i>Limon</i>, with its Pores all fill’d
up with Liquor. The <i>Branchery</i>
is likewise double: The <i>Exterior</i>
runs betwixt the <i>Pill</i> and outer <i>Parenchyma</i>
in arched Lines, from
the <i>Stalk</i> to the <i>Stool</i> of the <i>Flower</i>.
These outer Branches, though
of various number at the <i>Stalk</i>,
yet at the <i>Cork</i> are usually ten
principal ones; five for the five
Leaves of the <i>Flower</i>, and five for
the <i>Chives</i>. The inner main Branches
are two, diametrically opposite
to each other, and at the <i>Cork</i>
with the other inosculated. From
these two are branched other smaller,
every one having a <i>Seed</i> appendent
to it, whose Coats it entreth
by a double Filament, one
at the <i>Basis</i>, the other at the <i>Cone</i>.
They are all very white and turgent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and by a slaunt cut, may be
observ’d concave; thus representing themselves
analogous to so many
true <i>spermatick Vessels</i>.</p>

<p>The Uses of <i>Fruits</i> are for <i>Man</i>,
(sometimes also other <i>Animals</i>, as
are <i>Akerns</i> and <i>Haws</i>) and for the
<i>Seed</i>. For Man, they are so variously
desirable, that till our Orchards
and Store-Chambers, <i>Confectioners</i>
Stores and <i>Apothecaries</i>
Shops, our Ladies Closets, their
Tables or Hands are empty of
them, I shall not need to enquire
for what. If it be asked, how
the Fruit becomes, generally above
all the other Parts, so pleasant
a Meat? It is partly from the
<i>Sap</i>, the grosser portion thereof
being deposited in the Leaves, and
so the purer hereunto reserved;
partly from the Globular Figure of
the Fruit; for the <i>Sap</i> being thus
in a greater quantity herein, and in
all parts equally diffus’d, the Concoction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
hereof is with greatest advantage
favoured and promoted.
Wherefore all Fruits which we eat
raw, how small soever, are of a
Globular form, or thereunto approaching;
and the nearer, the
delicater; amongst <i>apples</i>, the <i>Peppin</i>;
amongst <i>Pears</i>, the <i>Burgundian</i>;
and amongst all Fruits, the
<i>Grape</i>; and amongst <i>Grapes</i>, the
roundest, are of all the most dainty.</p>

<p>The visible cause of this Globular
Figure, is the <i>Flower</i>; or the
Inosculation of all the main Branches
at the <i>Stool</i> of the <i>Flower</i>;
and upon the fall of the <i>Flower</i>,
the obtuseness, and with Wind and
Sun, as it were the searing of their
several ends: For thus the <i>Sap</i> entring
the <i>Fruit</i>, being not able to
effect, either a Disunion, or a
shooting forth of the said Branches,
and so to carry on their growth in
length; they must thus of necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
be enarch’d, and with the <i>Parenchyma</i>
more and more expand
themselves. Whereas were they
dispos’d and qualified otherwise,
than as is said, instead of forming
a Fruit within bounds, they would
run out into all extravagance, and
even into another little Tree or
Leafy growth.</p>

<p>To the <i>Seed</i>, the <i>Fruit</i> is serviceable;
First, in order to its being
supply’d with a due and most convenient
<i>Sap</i>, the greater and less
elaborated part thereof being, in
its passage towards the <i>Seed</i>, thereinto
received; the <i>Fruit</i> doing the
same office to the <i>Seed</i>, which the
<i>Leaves</i> do to the <i>Fruit</i>; the <i>Sap</i>
in the <i>Fruit</i> being in a laxe comparison,
as the <i>Wine</i>; and that for
the <i>Seed</i>, a small part of the highest
Spirit rectified from it.</p>

<p>So likewise for its Protection, in
order to the prosperous carrying
on and perfecting of its generation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and security being perfected.
Which protection it gives not only
to the Seminal <i>Sap</i> and <i>Seed</i> it
self; but alwaies also to its <i>Seed-Branch</i>.
Thus we see an <i>Apple</i>,
besides that it is it self of ample
compass, for the sake of its <i>Seed</i>,
hath likewise its <i>coar</i>; as if it
were not sufficient, that the Walls
of their Room are so very thick,
unless also wainscotted. In a <i>Pear</i>
again, where the <i>Parenchyma</i> is of
less compass than that of an <i>Apple</i>,
to what protection this affords, that
of the <i>Calculary</i> is super-added.
But in a <i>Plum</i>, where the <i>Parenchyma</i>
is exceeding tender, and in a
<i>Peach</i>, which hangs late, and till
Autumn Frosts approach, we have
not only the Rubbish of a <i>Calculary</i>
but stout Stone-Walls. Within
which also, not only the <i>Seed</i>
it self; but the <i>Seed-Branch</i> is evermore
immur’d. Lastly, in a <i>Nut</i>,
where the <i>shell</i> being not surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
with a <i>Parenchyma</i>, that protection
is wanting without, ’tis answer’d
by an ample <i>Pith</i> within it;
and the <i>seed-Branch</i> likewise included,
not meerly in the Body
of the Shell, as in a <i>Plum</i>, but within
the <i>pith</i> it self. So necessary is
this design that what the Hen by
Incubation or Hovering, is to the
Egg or Chick; that the whole
<i>Fruit</i>, by comprehension, is to the
<i>Seed</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Seed.</i></span></h2>

<p class="dropcap">As the Original, so the ultimate
end &amp; Perfection of <i>Vegetation</i>
is the <i>Seed</i>. How it is the
former, and in its state apt for <i>Vegetation</i>,
hath already been seen.
How the latter, and in its state of
Generation, we shall now lastly
enquire. In doing which, what
in the other state was either not distinctly
existent, or not so apparent,
or not so intelligible, will
occur.</p>

<p>The two general Parts of the
<i>Seed</i> are its <i>Covers</i> and <i>Body</i>. The
<i>Covers</i> in this estate are usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
four; the outmost we may call the
<i>Case</i>: ’Tis of a very various form;
sometimes a <i>Pouch</i>, as in <i>Nasturtium</i>,
<i>Cochlearia</i>; a <i>Cod</i>, as in all <i>Pulse</i>,
<i>Galega</i>; sometimes not entire, but
parted, or otherwise open, as in
<i>Sorrel</i>, <i>Knotgrass</i>, with many other
forms; I think alwaies more heterogeneous
to that of the <i>Seed</i>, by
which it differs from the proper
Coats. To this the Caps of <i>Nuts</i>,
and the <i>Parenchyma’s</i> of Fruits are
analogous.</p>

<p>The two next are properly the
Coats: In a <i>Bean</i> especially, and
the like; from whence to avoyd
Confusion, the denomination may
run common to the responding
Covers of other <i>Seeds</i>. The Colour
of the outer is of all degrees,
from White to the Blackness of
<i>Jett</i>: Its Figure sometimes Kidney’d,
as in <i>Alcea</i>, <i>Behen</i>, <i>Poppy</i>;
triangular, as in <i>Polygonatum</i>, <i>Sorrel</i>;
triangular spherical, in <i>Mentha</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
<i>Melissa</i>; circular, in <i>Leucoium</i>,
<i>Amaranthus</i>; globular, in
<i>Napus</i>, <i>Asperula</i>; oval, in <i>Speculum
Veneris</i>, <i>Tithymalus</i>; half
Globe, in <i>Coriander</i>; that which
we take for one single round <i>Seed</i>,
being a Conjugation of two; half
Oval, in <i>Anise</i>, <i>Fennel</i>; Hastal,
in <i>Lactuca</i>; Cylindrical, as, if I
mistake not, in <i>Jacobæa</i>, Pyramidal,
in <i>Geranium</i>, <i>Althææ Fol.</i> with
many other differences: But the
Perfection of one or two of the
said Figures lieth in the <i>Case</i>: So
that as all Lines and Proportions
are in the <i>Flower</i>, so all Regular
Figures in the <i>Seed</i>, or rather in its
<i>Covers</i>.</p>

<p>’Tis sometimes glistering, as in
<i>Speculum Veneris</i>; Rough-cast, in
<i>Catanance</i>; Studded, in <i>Behen</i>,
<i>Blattaria</i>; Favous, in <i>Papaver</i>,
<i>Antirrhinum</i>, <i>Lepidium annuum</i>,
<i>Alcea Vesicaria</i>, <i>Hyosciamus</i>, and
many more, before the <i>Seeds</i> have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
lain long by; Pounced, in <i>Phalangium
Cretæ</i>, <i>Lithospermum</i>; Ramified,
in <i>Pentaphyllum fragiferum</i>,
<i>Erectum majus</i>, resembling the Fibres
of the Ears of the Heart;
some just <i>Quinquenerval</i>, as in
<i>Anisum</i>, and many more, the <i>Lignous
Body</i> being in five main Fibres
branched therein.</p>

<p>The Covers of not only <i>Quince</i>-Seeds,
and those of <i>Psyllium</i> (more
usually taken notice of) but those
also of <i>Horminum</i>, <i>Nasturtium</i>,
<i>Eruca</i>, <i>Camelina</i>, <i>Ocymum</i>, and divers
others, have a <i>Mucilage</i>;
which, though it be not visible
when the Seeds are throughly dry;
yet lying a while in some warm
Liquor, or only on the Tongue, it
swells more or less, and upon them
all fairly shews it self. On that of
<i>Ocymum</i> it appears grayish; on the
other, transparent; and on that of
<i>Nasturtium Hortense</i> very large; even
emulous of the inner Pulp surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a <i>Gooseberry-seed</i>. The
putting of <i>Clary-seed</i> into the Eye,
may have been brought into use
from this <i>Mucilage</i>, by which alone
it may become Medicinal.
And thus far of the <i>Superficies</i>.</p>

<p>The nature of the outer Coat is
various, <i>Membranous</i>, <i>Cartilaginous</i>
and <i>Stony</i>; the like <i>Precipitations</i>
being sometimes made herein,
as in a Stone or Shell; as in that
of the Seeds of <i>Carthamum</i>, <i>Lithospermum</i>,
and others. The Designment
hereof, being either with
respect to the <i>Seed</i> in its state of
Generation; as where the Case is
either wanting, or at least insufficient
of it self, there for its due
protection and warmth; or, in its
state of <i>Vegetation</i>, for the better
Fermenting of its Tinctures and
<i>Sap</i>; the Fermentations of some
<i>Seeds</i> not well proceeding, unless
they lie in their Stony Casks in the
Mould, like Bottled Liquors in
Sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>All <i>Seeds</i> have their outer Covers
open; either by a particular
<i>Foramen</i>, as in <i>Beans</i>, and other
<i>Pulse</i>, as is said; or by the breaking
off of the <i>Seed</i> from its <i>Peduncle</i>
or <i>Stool</i>, as in those in <i>Cucumber</i>,
<i>Cycory</i>; or by the entering and
passage of a <i>Branch</i> or <i>Branches</i>, not
only into the Concave thereof near
the Cone, but also through the
Cone it self; as in <i>Shells</i> and
<i>Stones</i>.</p>

<p>For the sake of this <i>aperture</i> it is,
that <i>Akerns</i>, <i>Nuts</i>, <i>Beans</i>, <i>Cucumbers</i>,
and most other <i>Seeds</i>, are
in their formation so placed, that
the <i>Radicle</i> still standeth next to
it; that, upon <i>Vegetation</i>, it may
have a free and ready passage into
the Mould.</p>

<p>The Original of the outer Coat,
though from Parts of the same substantial
nature, yet is differently
made. In a <i>Plum</i>, the <i>Seed-Branch</i>
which runs, as is described, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the Stone, is not naked, but, as is
said, invested with a thin <i>Parenchyma</i>,
which it carries from the
Stalk along with it; and which,
by the <i>Ramification</i> of the said
<i>Branch</i> within the Stone, is in part
dilated into a Coat. That of a
<i>Bean</i> is from the <i>Parenchyma</i> of the
Cod; the superficial part of which
<i>Parenchyma</i>, upon the large <i>peduncle</i>
of the <i>Bean</i> becoming a thin
Cuticle, and upon the <i>Bean</i> it self
a <i>cartilaginous</i> Coat.</p>

<p>The Original of the inner Coat
of the <i>Bean</i> is likewise from the
inner part of the said <i>parenchyma</i>;
which first is spred into a long Cake,
or that which with the <i>seed-Branch</i>
maketh the <i>peduncle</i> of the <i>Bean</i>;
under which Cake, there is usually
a black part or spot; by the length
of which, the inner part of the
Cake is next inserted into the outer
Coat, and spred all over the
Concave thereof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>This inner Coat, though when
the <i>Seed</i> is grown old and dry, ’tis
shrunk up, and in most Seeds so
far as scarcely to be discern’d; yet
in its first and juvenile Constitution,
is a very Spongy and Sappy
Body; and is then likewise (as
the <i>Womb</i> in a pregnant Animal)
in proportion very thick and bulky;
in a <i>Bean</i>, even as one of the
<i>Lobes</i> it self: And in a <i>Plum</i> or
<i>apricot</i>, I think I may safely say,
half an hundred times thicker than
afterwards, when it is dried and
shrunk up; and can scarcely be
distinguished from the upper Coat.
Upon which Accounts it is, in this
estate, a true and fair <i>Parenchyma</i>.</p>

<p>In this Inner Coat in a <i>Bean</i>,
the <i>Lignous Body</i> or <i>Seed-Branch</i>
is distributed: Sometimes, as in
<i>French-Beans</i>, throughout the
whole Coat; as it is in a Leaf:
In the Great <i>Garden-Bean</i>, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
its first entrance, it is bipartite, and
so in small Branches runs along the
Circumference of the Coat, all
meeting and making a kind of Reticulation
against the Belly of the
<i>Bean</i>. In the same manner the
main Branches in the outer Coat
of a <i>Kernel</i>, circling themselves
on both hands from the place of
their first entrance, at last meet,
and mutually inosculate.</p>

<p>So that all the Parts of a <i>Vegetable</i>,
the <i>Root</i>, <i>Trunk</i>, <i>Branch</i>, <i>Leaf</i>,
<i>Flower</i>, <i>Fruit</i> and <i>Seed</i>, are still
made up of two substantially different
Bodies.</p>

<p>And as every Part hath two, so
the whole <i>Vegetable</i> taken together,
is a composition of two only,
and no more: All properly
Woody Parts, Strings and Fibres,
are one Body: All simple <i>Barques</i>,
<i>Piths</i>, <i>Parenchyma’s</i> and <i>Pulps</i>, and
as to their substantial Nature, <i>Pills</i>
and <i>Skins</i> likewise, all but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Body: the several Parts of a <i>Vegetable</i>
all differing from each other,
only by the various Proportions
and Mixtures, and variously sized
Pores of these two Bodies. What
from these two general Observations
might reasonably be inferr’d, I
shall not now mention.</p>

<p>The fourth and innermost Cover
we may call the <i>Secondine</i>; the
sight whereof, by cutting off the
Coats of an <i>Infant-Bean</i>, at the
Cone thereof in very thin Slices,
and with great Caution, may be
obtain’d. While unbroken, ’tis
transparent; being torn and taken
off, it gathers up into the likeness
of a Jelly, or that we call the <i>Tredle</i>
of an Egg, when over-boyl’d.
This <i>Membrane</i> in larger or elder
<i>Beans</i>, is not to be found distinct;
but becomes as it were the Lining of
the inner Coat: But (as far as our Enquiries
yet discover) it may in most
other <i>Seeds</i>, even full grown, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
distinctly seen; as in those of <i>Cucumber</i>,
<i>Colocynthis</i>, <i>Burdock</i>,
<i>Carthamum</i>, <i>Gromwel</i>, <i>Endive</i>,
<i>Mallows</i>, &amp;c. ’Tis usually so very
thin, as in the above-nam’d, as
very difficultly to be discover’d.
In some <i>Kernels</i>, as of <i>Apricots</i>,
’tis very thick; and in some other
Seeds. That all these have the Analogy
of one and the same Cover,
which I call the <i>Secondine</i>, is most
probably argu’d from their alike
Natures; being all of them plain
simple <i>Membranes</i>, with not the
least Fibre of the <i>Lignous Body</i> or
<i>Seed Branch</i>, visibly distributed in
them; as also from their Contexture,
which is in all of them more
close.</p>

<p>The Concave of this <i>Membrane</i>
is filled with a most transparent Liquor,
out of which the Seed is
formed; as in cutting a <i>petite</i> and
<i>Infant-Bean</i>, may be seen; and
yet better in a young <i>Walnut</i>. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
<i>Beans</i> I have observed it to turn,
upon boyling, into a tender white
<i>coagulum</i>.</p>

<p>Through this <i>Membrane</i>, the <i>Lignous
Body</i> or <i>Seed-Branches</i> distributed
in the inner Coat, at last
shoot downright two slender Fibres,
like two Navles, one into each
<i>Lobe</i> of the <i>Bean</i>. The places where
the said Fibres shoot into the <i>Lobes</i>,
are near the <i>Basis</i> of the <i>Radicle</i>;
and by their Blackishness well enough
remark’d: but the Fibres
themselves are so very small, as
scarcely to be discern’d: Yet in a
<i>Lupine</i>, of the larger kind, both
the places where the Navel-Fibres
shoot into the <i>Lobes</i> (which here
from the <i>Basis</i> of the <i>Radicle</i> is
more remote) and the Fibres themselves,
are fairly visible. For the
<i>Seed-Branch</i>, upon its entrance into
the Coat of the <i>Lupine</i>, is presently
divided into two <i>main Branches</i>,
and those two into other less;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
whereof some underly, others aloft,
run along the Coat, and towards
its other end meet and are
inosculated; where about two opposite,
shallow, round, and most
minute Cavities, answerable to
two Specks of a <i>cartilaginous</i> gloss,
one in either <i>Lobe</i>, may be observed,
which Specks are the ends of
the said <i>Navel-Fibres</i>, upon the
ripening of the <i>Seed</i> there broken
off. These Fibres, from the Superficies
of each <i>Lobe</i>, descend a
little way directly down; presently,
each is divided into two Branches,
one distributed into the
<i>Lobes</i>, the other into the <i>Radicle</i> &amp;
<i>Plume</i>, in the manner as in <a href="#CHAP_I">the first
Chapter</a> is describ’d. And thus
far the History. I shall now only
with a brief account of the <i>Generation</i>
of the <i>Seed</i>, as hereupon
dependent, conclude this Discourse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us say then, that the <i>Sap</i>
having in the <i>Root</i>, <i>Trunk</i>, and
<i>Leaves</i>, passed divers Concoctions
and Separations, in the manner as
they are said to be perform’d therein;
’tis now at last, in some good
maturity, advanced towards the
<i>Seed</i>.</p>

<p>The more copious and cruder
part hereof is again seperated by a
free reception into the <i>Fruit</i>, or
other Part analogous to it: being
either sufficiently ample to contain
it, or at least laxe enough for its
transpiration, and so its due discharge.
The more Essential part
is into the <i>Seed-Branch</i> or Branches
entertain’d; which, because they
are evermore of a very considerable
length, and of a Constitution
very fine, the said <i>Sap</i> thus becomes
in its Current therein, as in
the <i>Spermatick Vessels</i>, still more
mature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>In this mature estate, from the
<i>seed-Branch</i> into the Coats of the
<i>seed</i>, as into the Womb, ’tis next
delivered up. The meaner Part
hereof again, to the outer, as <i>aliment</i>
good enough, is supplied.
The finer part is transmitted to
the Inner; which, being, as is
said, a <i>Parenchymous</i> and more spatious
Body, the <i>Sap</i> therefore is
not herein, as in the outer, a meer
<i>aliment</i>; but in order to its being,
by Fermentation, farther prepared.</p>

<p>Yet the outer Coat, being on
the contrary hard and dense; for
that reason, as it admitteth not
the Fermentation of the <i>Sap</i> so well
within it self; so doth it the more
promote and favour it in the Inner,
being Bounds both to it and
its <i>Sap</i>; and also quickneth the
process of the whole Work in the
formation of the <i>Seed</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor doth the outer Coat, for
the same reason, more promote
than declare the purity of the <i>Sap</i>
now contained in the Inner: For
being more hard and dense, and
so not perspirable, must needs
suppose the Parts of the <i>Sap</i> encompassed
by it, since thus uncapable
of any evacuation, to be
therefore all, so choice, as not to
need it.</p>

<p>The <i>Sap</i> being thus prepared in
the inner Coat, as a Liquor now
apt to be the <i>Substratum</i> of the future
<i>Seed-Embrio</i>, by fresh supplies,
is thence discharged; yet that it
may not be over-copious; which,
because of the laxity of the Inner
Coat from whence it issues, it
might easily be; therefore as the
said inner Coat is bounded without
by the upper Coat, so by the <i>Secondine</i>
or <i>Membrane</i> is it bounded
within; through which <i>Membrane</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the <i>Sap</i> being filtr’d, or, as it were,
transpiring, the depositure hereof,
answerable to the <i>Colliquamentum</i>
in an Egg, or to the <i>semen
Mulibre</i>, into its Concave at last is
made.</p>

<p>The other Part of the purest <i>sap</i>
embosom’d in the Ramulets of the
<i>seed-Branch</i>, runs a Circle, or some
progress therein; and so becomes,
as the <i>Semen Masculinum</i>, yet more
elaborate.</p>

<p>Wherein also, lest its Current
should be too copious or precipitate,
by their co-arcture and divarication
where they are inosculated,
it is retarded; the noblest
portion only obtaining a pass.</p>

<p>With this purest <i>sap</i>, the said
<i>Ramulets</i> being supplied, from
thence at last, the <i>Navel-Fibres</i>
shoot (as the privitive <i>Artery</i> into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the <i>Colliquamentum</i>) through the
<i>Secondine</i> into the aforesaid Liquor
deposited therein.</p>

<p>Into which Liquor, being now
shot, and its own proper Sap or
Tinctures mixed therewith, it
strikes it thus into a <i>Coagulum</i>; or,
of a Liquor, it becomes a Body
consistent and truly <i>Parenchymous</i>;
and the supply of the said Liquor
still continu’d, and the shooting
of the Navel-Fibres, as is above
described, still carried on, and
therewith the said <i>Coagulation</i> or
<i>Fixation</i> likewise.</p>

<p>And in the Interim of the <i>Coagulation</i>,
a gentle <i>Fermentation</i>
being also made, the said <i>Parenchyma</i>
or <i>Coagulum</i> becometh
such, not of any Constitution
indifferently, but is thus raised
(as we see Bread in Baking)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
into a <i>Congeries</i> of <i>Fixed Bubbles</i>:
For such is the <i>Parenchyma</i>
of the whole Seed.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
